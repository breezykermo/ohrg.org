<!-- Filter buttons will be inserted here for index.html -->
<p>This site has suffered another dramatic pause in proceedings, on the
order of a month again, due to a writing submission that has at last
been shipped. The subject was Marx's qualification of the movement of
value in <em>Capital</em> as an "automatic subject" <span
class="citation" data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical1992">(Marx
1992, 255)</span>, which I set out to assess in conversation with the
human-machine relation in Marx, as part of a broader project that
estimates whether there is anything to ground the capital-computer
relation in value-theoretical philosophy. As seems to be becoming
typical of my writing process, I did not get as far into the matter in
the allotted 20-25 double-spaced pages (the suggested length of the
submission) as I had intended when laying out the essay's structure: yet
this is by no means a bad thing, as it means that I have a very concrete
idea of how to extend the essay I have just submitted should it turn out
to be interesting enough (to its critics) to warrant that further
engagement.</p>
<p>I am undecided on whether I ought to put up drafts such as this one
just described here. On the one hand, I see no good reason - in the
spirit of writing not as a commercial and proprietary undertaking, but
as a privilege for which the structure of a PhD luxuriantly gives me the
time - to get into the habit of sitting on writing. I understand that
this is something of a common practice in academia; as writing
<em>is</em> a commercial asset, perhaps the most essential asset that
humanistic scholars have to bargain with on the job market. It is deemed
essential, in this world, to be smart about where and when one
publishes. This requisite culture of smarts materializes (in America, at
least, though I think elsewhere as well) in a proprietary and protective
culture of knowledge production, in which younger scholars have to learn
the unspoken principles of when to share, and when to sit quiet on an
idea, for fear that someone might 'steal' it.</p>
<p>I have always found the rationalization of this culture somewhat
absurd. Isn't academia supposed to counterweight the capitalist
enclosure of knowledge production, and offer space and time in which one
can think "freely"? Of course, there are the material realities of the
job market - wherein junior scholars are fed the notion that it will
hinder their chances of finding a position if they do not have a certain
number of publications in a certain quality of journal - but don't many
of us go into academia for the very point of thinking aspirationally
otherwise? This is not to condemn the student who "plays the game"
effectively; but it is to suggest that, if there is anything
counter-capitalist and free-thinking about academia as an alternative to
corporate knowledge production, it must be more than just playing the
game. Is academia's atmosphere of career advancement really so
suffocating that we should see so few students or professors (in the
humanities) contesting the ossified publication pathways and
experimenting with self-publishing drafts or other mechanisms of
disseminating work beyond journal-ist enterprise?</p>
<p>The precarity of the humanities in tertiary institutions is no doubt
a contributing factor. Threatened by their growingly apparent
"uselessness" as training for the wider world, degrees and departments
in the humanities are subject to budget cuts and general
deprioritization by administrative tiers of the university; tiers that
seem to operate more and more according to a logic that treats the
university as a (joint-stock?) company rather than a haven for academic
freedom. With fewer and fewer positions, it appears more and more stupid
to go out on a limb and challenge the lineaments of what it means to be
a successful scholar, especially in the earlier stages of one's career.
Hang tight to the fraying ropes of what tenure-track lines remain, the
general prescription seems to be. One's PhD is not the right time to
question or challenge the gymnasium structure.</p>
<p>From the privileged vantage point of having a career (as a software
engineer) that I can fall back on, this medicament seems too much like
giving in to the predicament and letting capital run its course. I am
under no misconception that publishing drafts or pre-prints, rather than
keeping quiet and hoping to instead get writing in prestigious and
peer-reviewed journals, should represent any kind of anti- or
counter-capitalist action. But don't we agree that the academic journal
system is broken? Whether it always was, or whether the Internet (in
conjunction with the PDF, perhaps) fundamentally undermined it, it seems
silly to insist that we shouldn't experiment with Substack, with
self-publication via public websites, etc, both as established academics
and as early-stage scholars. Will making pre-prints available nose-dive
my chances of publishing anything in journals? Will I then have to
explain to future prospective employers why my publication credentials
don't match the prestige of other candidates? Maybe. But I didn't come
to grad school <em>solely</em> to submit to a quiescent world of
barriers to entry and false consciousness. One must keep one's idealism
too, if there is any hope of freedom.</p>

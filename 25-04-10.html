<p>Psychoanalysis was once described as a ‘calling card’ that was to be
left at the door of Science. The idea here, I think, was that
psychoanalysis should not become (as Freud envisioned it in his first
explorations of it) a ‘science’ in the sense of having an answer for
everything. If psychoanalysis were to become a theory that accommodated
every possible thing, every possible action, to foreclose all
possibility of surprise within its framework, then it would be no better
than a worldview (or <em>Weltanschauung</em>, in German). Incidentally,
Freud dismissed Marxism as too much of a worldview, and therefore Marx’s
account of the world is not something to which, Freud thought,
psychoanalysis should aspire.</p>
<p>Instead, psychoanalysis– as a truer kind of science than the Science
that Freud criticized–the institutionalized Science of physics,
chemistry, applied mathematics, and perhaps biology– should be a
technique that Science turns to in an idle moment, when one of its
formulae fails to produce an adequate account of some happening in the
lab; when the scientist is racking her brains, late at work one night,
trying to reduce some recalcitrant experiment to an eloquent result.
Psychoanalysis, the calling card analogy suggests, is the method that
one might turn to in this confounded moment when the structures of
organized knowledge seem exhausted, misguided, or just plain wrong. When
something (in society) no longer works, and one needs to find the will
to try to make something work again, even as it seems that the world has
firm ideas otherwise.</p>
<p>The psychoanalytic clinic (the calling card left at each of our
aporetic doors) is an institution with a serious kind of humility. In
its best form, it doesn’t offer answers, only spaces for its subjects to
ask more fundamental questions. As Mladen Dolar puts it, the analyst in
the clinic</p>
<blockquote>
<p>utters at the most an "Oh!" here and there… he makes himself an
automaton in order to give rise to the dimension of the Other, the real
interlocutor of the patient's "monologue," and also in order to produce
that strange kind of love, perhaps love in its strictest and purest
sense, which is transference love.<span class="citation"
data-cites="dolarShallBeYou1991">(Dolar 1991, 9)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proper analyst doesn’t suppose to cure the subject of her ills
and maladies, her maladaptations to a broken society, but rather first
and foremost seeks to open a space where the subject can start again,
where association will no longer be strictly limited by habit,
pathology, or unwanted automatisms. Michael Pollan has described the
experience of ingesting psychedelic substances as a fresh snowfall on
the mountain of one’s mind, where the grooves that have been worn to the
earth can be rediscovered or altered– and perhaps this is a kind of
description of the successful analytic session, too. Afterwards, the
subject can choose the way she thinks, again. When a certain logic of
understanding the world has revealed itself as uncertain, incomplete, or
unreliable, the clinic should be a calling card. Thought can start
again, the suggestion seems to promise, even if we are scientifically
sure that it never really can.</p>
<p>The question for analytic bureaucracy is this: if uncertainty is a
given, is there anywhere the analysts should stake a claim to certainty?
The psychoanalytic philosophical tradition can be read as a kind of
reckoning with this epistemological impasse. How does one build an
institution when the surety of its foundations are in question? If this
question forms the ground of psychoanalysis as a philosophy and as an
aspirationally ‘true’ science (instead of yet another
<em>Weltangschauung</em>), then perhaps it is to the clinic that we
should turn for an institution that will practice restraint when it
comes to the inevitable desire to totalize, to be something for
everyone, rather than simply everything for someone.</p>

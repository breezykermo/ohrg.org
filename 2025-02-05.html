<p>Over the holiday period (which I count as the entirety of January, as
my wedding took place on the 11th January, and I have not seriously
returned to work until very recently) I read <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Marx_Was_Right">Why Marx was
Right</a> by Terry Eagleton. The book was given to me by my father– over
in Italy from New Zealand for the aforementioned wedding– as he had gone
out and bought it after I had sent my dissertation prospectus to the
family group chat, a document that makes clear that Marx's thought is a
very major focus in my current work.</p>
<p>I hadn't heard of the book before, and was delighted to discover what
I think is a very accessible introduction to many of the key aspects of
Marx's thought that drew and draw me to it. Indeed, I wish that I had
known about the book when putting together the syllabus for my class on
Marx last semester (<a href="./24-12-27.html">discussed in the first
section here</a>), as it guides the reader towards the salient aspects
of why Marx remains relevant without assuming that they have already
laboured through <em>Capital</em>. Now that I do, it has become the
gateway drug of choice when I am accosted with the
by-now-seemingly-age-old question, dredged up equally often in
non-academic and academic discussions regarding the focus of my
dissertation; 'but why study Marx'?</p>
<p>Each chapter in Eagleton's delectable little book takes a
misconception about Marx head on, explaining why it is unfounded. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Marx_Was_Right">wikipedia
page</a> does an excellent job of outlining the lines of argumentation
in summative depth, so I'll just bullet them here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Marx's critique has no bearing on 21st century society, as it deals
with 19th century concerns such as factories and food riots.</li>
<li>Marxism in theory is for faux-left academics, as in practice it
always becomes ``a monstrously oppressive state".</li>
<li>Marx's notion of history was overly deterministic, positing a
'necessary' transition to socialism/communism that never came
about.</li>
<li>Humans are inherently selfish, and so the dream of communism is
hopelessly utopian and fundamentally unrealistic.</li>
<li>Marx's thought was too invested in economic reduction, and as such
is fundamentally less rich as a tradition of thought than more
contemporary, more pluralistic alternatives.</li>
<li>Marx's 'materialism' drains humanity of everything spiritual,
crudely envisioning the worlds as nothing but what there is, and as such
always ends up in undesirable states of society when applied, as the
history of the 20th century proves.</li>
<li>Marx's conception of class is limited to his time, and can't help us
to understand the diffuse hierarchies of social standing in today's
world.</li>
<li>Marxist revolution is inherently violent.</li>
<li>Marxist revolution can only end in a Foucauldian all-powerful state,
and thus the theory is inseparably married to unfreedom at some
fundamental level.</li>
<li>The political Left today is not well-explained or supported by Marx
or Marxism, and thus we should prefer other theories.</li>
</ol>
<p>Needless to say, as the sanguinely simple title of Eagleton's book
implies, all of these allegations are unfounded at best; and, more
likely, just plain wrong. It is, in fact, astonishing how relevant
Marx's thought remains today, given how much political and historical
distance there is between us and him. Indeed, we live in wake of an
executive order given by a popularly elected president of the U.S. <a
href="https://rollcall.com/2025/01/27/trump-white-house-orders-freeze-on-federal-grants-loans/">to
root out 'Marxist equity'</a>; and I will continue to argue that
concieving clearly both of what such equity would look like if it were
to appear is some of the most important scholarly work that, if
philosophy and critical thinking is to remain a valued part of organized
society, for which we should carve out space and time at universities,
even as the capitalist assault on the enduring value of critical thought
intensifies (t)here.</p>
<p>Eagleton's book is not just an accessible introduction, however. Its
footnotes are concise yet sharp, pointed the more interested reader
towards secondary literature and sections of Marx's ouevre that deserve
closer attention. The influence of Fourier on Marx's political
philosophy of utopia, for example, is a connection that I intend to
follow up on in the coming months, having as it may interesting
ramifications in the course of my study on what mathematical contours
exist in <em>Capital</em> and Marx's other works. Balibar's book
<em>Philosophy of Marx</em>– which I had bulleted on my <a
href="./24-01-26.html">lists</a>, but have still not yet read– is also
mentioned for Balibar's characterization of Marx as an
<em>antiphilosopher</em>; a nomination that accords with my continually
reinforced conception of Marx as one of the great masters of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics_of_suspicion">suspicion</a>.</p>
<p>There are also some comments in the book that help me to carve out
space to concieve of Marx's system as a philosophy (or anti-philosophy,
perhaps) of the subject. (No doubt this is the terrain that Balibar will
cover in that book, when I finally come around to reading it.) In the
chapter on why Marx is not a crude materialist (chapter 6), for example,
Eagleton cleverly shows how it is really capitalist 'philosophy' that is
culpable of painting everything simply 'as it is', leaving no space for
an imagination otherwise. (This being the source of Fred Jameson's /
Mark Fisher's <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zizek/comments/w0u7ca/who_actually_said_its_easier_to_imagine_the_end/">quip</a>
that 'it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is the end of
capitalism') The unfreedom of imagination otherwise in capitalism,
Eagleton argues, is a feature and not a bug for that system's zombified
reproduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prejudice that thought is independent of reality is itself shaped
by social reality. <span class="citation"
data-cites="eagletonWhyMarxWas2011">(Eagleton 2011, 135)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not too far to go from this claim to the insight that consumed
the working life of Alfred Sohn-Rethel, for which I quote from my
prospectus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though Sohn-Rethel is best known for coining the phrase 'real
abstraction' (principally popularized by way of its mention in Adorno's
<em>Negative Dialectics</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="adornoLecturesNegativeDialectics2014">(Adorno 2014)</span>),
the radical claim on which his sole philosophical monograph,
<em>Intellectual and Manual Labor</em>, rests is this: ``Exchange
abstraction is not thought, but it has the form of thought" <span
class="citation"
data-cites="sohn-rethelIntellectualManualLabour1978">(Sohn-Rethel 1978,
99)</span>. The idea that there is a <em>formal</em> relation between
the transcendental subject ("thought") and the political economy, i.e.
the structure of a set of social relations that cannot necessarily be
simply reduced to the sum of conscious operations of its constituents,
situates Marx in a mathematical-philosophical lineage with which he is
not always directly associated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marx's work, as Eagleton recognizes, is not just a sociological,
historically-specific treatise on the unjust structure of nascent
capitalism in the 19th century; though it is certainly that. It is also
``a theory of how historical animals function" <span class="citation"
data-cites="eagletonWhyMarxWas2011">(Eagleton 2011, 158)</span>, which
is to say, a philosophy of the (human) subject, a serious reckoning with
whether or not there is anything philosophical (trans-historical) that
can be said about society, or whether we are doomed to never be
justified in abstracting from a specific time and a specific place,
wherein not only is the map not the territory, but the map is never
anything useful or justified at all.</p>

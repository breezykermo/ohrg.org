<!-- Filter buttons will be inserted here for index.html -->
<p>It's been a few days since I logged; so a couple of thoughts are due
today. The first is regarding Zizek's 1989 book <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sublime_Object_of_Ideology">The
Sublime Object of Ideology</a>, which is one of the "first" in my list
on science and psychoanalysis. This book is absolutely essential for a
number of reasons. Among the most important is that it represents some
of the foundational work in relating Lacan's thought to Hegel, Marx, and
Kant. The radical line of argumentation that Lacan's thought represents
for Zizek (against postmodernism, historicism, Habermas'
"post-structuralism") is integral to a thoughtful understanding of
science.</p>
<p>By "thoughtful" here, I mean to take issue with two colloquial and
common understandings of science: the first too idealist, and the second
too materialist.</p>
<p>The too-idealist understanding of science posits it as a system of
thought that ultimately represents a <em>true</em> approximation of the
world. Some version of this view is, I would think, the operational view
of many scientists and 'scientifically minded' associates. Science is a
system of laws, in other words, that resides in thought (epistemology)
in such a way that it can fundamentally map onto that which resides in
the world (ontology). Epistemology, in this view, is nothing but a
lossless compression of ontology. While (some of) science's methods
might be flawed or approximate, the collective constellation of mind
(ideology) that results from them is plausibly flawless. Because
thought's representation of the world has no ontological instability,
scientific laws come to be considered essentially <em>objective</em>:
they exist independently ('materially') from minds that apprehend
them.</p>
<p>The too-materialist view is preponderant in the history of science,
humanities, and other disciplines that exclude themselves from
scientific requirement (and cachet). It similarly sees the methods of
science as approximations of what's at work in the world; but in
contradistinction to the too-idealists, it does not recognise
epistemology as plausibly lossless to ontological reality. In this view,
thought is necessarily an approximation of the world's chaos. It is not
the <em>transcription</em> of objective laws, but the
<em>translation</em> of them. Indeed, whether such laws exist at all
objectively is not up for debate, as thought and language themselves are
not thought to be capable of accurately representing them in any case.
The too-materialists tend to emphasize the necessary contingency of all
knowledge, and react forcefully to all kinds of generalization of
thought beyond its situation in a (suitably small) worldly context.
Thought here is impotent to apprehend the world. (In extreme cases, the
too-materialist malady leads to frightfully confusing arguments that we
must let world do more to apprehend itself.)</p>
<p>Zizek takes up the task of "rehabilitating psychoanalysis in its
philosophical core" <span class="citation"
data-cites="zizekSublimeObjectIdeology2009">(Zizek 2009, viii)</span> to
avoid the indefatigable spells of both the too-idealist and the
too-materialist. To do so, he argues that we must re-read Hegel through
Lacan, to develop a properly <strong>dialectical</strong> approach to
epistemology and ontology. Hegelian, Marxian, and Lacanian dialectics–
all of which Zizek sees as sharing a certain quality of thinking–
represent such an attempt to break of the spell of an un-dialectical
subject-object relation in philosophy.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In
the book's preface, he develops (in what is now recognised as typically
Zizekian fashion) a scatological understanding of Hegelian
<em>Aufhebung</em> with respect to the Lacanian notion of non-All. To
jump to the case of connecting Lacan's and Hegel's thought (and to
tastefully avoid all the other 'shit' in this rather complex
beginning):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the externality of Nature with regard to the Idea is not that of the
Idea's constitutive exception: it is not that Nature is set free as the
exception that guarantees the Wholeness of the Idea's self-mediation. It
is not the case that, once this mediation is complete (that is, after
the Idea's dialectical progress can no longer be propelled by the Idea's
own incompleteness - its failure to correspond to its own notion), the
completed Idea needs an external Other (Nature) to sustain the complete
and closed circle of its self-mediation. Nature is, rather, the mark of
the non-All of the Idea's totality. <span class="citation"
data-cites="zizekSublimeObjectIdeology2009">(Zizek 2009, xxi)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incompleteness is the essential element of Hegel's/Zizek's thought
that mediates between the too-idealist and too-materialist extremes of
scientific conception. If one takes 'Nature' in this quotation to
represent the the too-materialist, and 'Idea' the too-idealist, the
relevancy of Hegel's thought to the 'problem' of (thoughtful) science
becomes clear. Dialectic is the name given to the quality of method that
retains the insights of <em>both</em> materialism and idealism, without
subsuming one in favour of the other.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> More difficultly, the
relationship between Idea and Nature is understood as a <strong>mutual
incompleteness</strong>: "Nature is, rather, the mark of the non-All of
the Idea's totality." Epistemology is not sufficient in itself, for
there immanently resides an "constitutive exception" in it; i.e. a
moment that cannot be (rationally) grasped in its own 'native' terms.
This exception <em>is</em> what we call ontology, and the fact of this
exception is what makes Idea's totality "non-All".</p>
<p>Identically, (and this I find harder still to properly grasp),
<em>the Idea is only and always the constitutive exception of
Nature</em>. Thought appears as a "non-natural" thing in this
formulation, as the inverse of Nature in one sense; but crucially it is
Nature's <em>necessary</em> non-natural inverse. One cannot avoid this
non-naturalness of thought by returning it to the land, by giving Nature
a greater space in thought, because the two are dialectically entangled
and co-constitutive.</p>
<p>Zizek posits psychoanalysis as the philosophical tradition that works
against both materialist and idealist essentialism to establish a
dialectical logic of the Idea and Nature. The Freudian notion of the
<strong>death drive</strong> (infamously posited, then redeveloped and
revised several times throughout Freud's career) is an example of
psychoanalysis' dialectical approach, in that it frames the human as "an
animal extorted by an insatiable parasite (reason, <em>logos</em>,
language)" <span class="citation"
data-cites="zizekSublimeObjectIdeology2009">(Zizek 2009, xxvii)</span>;
an insolvable paradox of nature and nurture.</p>
<p>Zizek's brilliance in this book is to extend the re-reading of Hegel
through Lacan to the problem of <strong>democracy</strong>. This is
evidenced in its title: <em>The Sublime Object of Ideology</em>.
Ideology, a term readily associated with Althusser and Habermas, is
colloquially understood as a false consciousness that, once identified
and recognized, ought to disappear as if mist cleared on a windy day.
Viewed dialectically, however, ideology is the (necessary) product of
the incompleteness that bridges subjectivity and objectivity, the
"Sublime" (a term with Kantian undertones) to the "Object" (a word which
in its placement here echoes the Lacanian "objet petit a" or object
cause of desire). This position is a redemption of Hegel, a philosopher
who is often dismissed too chauvinistically idealist, and his philosophy
of the Subject/Substance relation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>far from being a story of its progressive overcoming, dialectics is
for Hegel a systematic notation of the failure of all such attempts -
'absolute knowledge' denotes a subjective position which finally accepts
'contradiction' as an internal condition of every identity. In other
words, Hegelian 'reconciliation' is not a 'panlogicist' sublation of all
reality in the Concept but a final consent to the fact that the Concept
itself is 'not-all' (to use this Lacanian term). <span class="citation"
data-cites="zizekSublimeObjectIdeology2009">(Zizek 2009,
xxix)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is striking how relevant this argument remains today in an
academic landscape seemingly rife with the "'post-modernist' traps"
<span class="citation"
data-cites="zizekSublimeObjectIdeology2009">(Zizek 2009, xxxi)</span>
that Hegel/Lacan/Zizek strive to avoid. Moreover, it was slightly
surprising to me how much of Marx there is in this book: as it is
through Marx that Zizek develops a robust connection between Kant-Hegel
(on one side of "history") and Freud-Lacan (on the "other"). (I will
develop a better sense of this statement in a forthcoming post regarding
the first chapter of <em>Sublime Object</em>, "How Did Marx Invent the
Symptom?") Though Zizek doesn't directly deal with Science, the
arguments in this masterful work of philosophy are essential for
bridging from my list on dialectics in history (Marx) to this list on
science in psychoanalysis (Lacan).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"

<!-- Filter buttons will be inserted here for index.html -->
<p>Today's work doesn't fit on one of my three tracks, as it consisted
of grading papers from a course for which I was a TA (Teaching
Assistant) in the Fall semester, <em>MCM 0150: Introduction to Modern
Culture and Media</em>. I submitted final grades for these papers for
the students in my section in late December, but I had (until today)
neglected to return students their final papers, annotated with
comments. Though returning these papers is not something that the
course's professors nor the University would strictly enforce, as from
their perspective a final grade is all that needs to be formally booked,
it feels churlish to not do so. As best I can, I am trying to avoid the
commonplace duplicity of suggestion in academic life, in which
professors consciously or otherwise suggest that they are "always" happy
and available to review work, but then rarely actually get back to
students when they recieve it. I recognize that this attitude is
produced by the increasingly neoliberal labour politics of the academy,
in which the boundary between work and life is supposed to exist only
for those who are not intellectually or emotionally equipped to deal
with their collateralising. As an aspiring academic, in other words, one
feels one <em>must</em> be open to be intellectually or pedagogically
available to all opportunities, especially those that are not obligatory
and/or are unpaid. To refuse these would be, to use a phrase from my
duologic life as a software engineer, to signal oneself as a bad
'cultural fit' for the academy.</p>
<p>I am against comporting oneself to such suggestions for their own
sake, or for the sake of 'staying with the trouble'. But giving time to
students is an undertaking that deserves a different category, not least
because it can often entail a rejection of the strictures and norms of
the academy's labour expectations, rather than succumbing to them. My
interest in properly attending to papers students send to me is really
more a reflection of the experience that I have had as an undergraduate
student, as a working person, and also as a graduate student of
struggling to find friends or fellows who will <em>actually</em> read
and discuss academic work. There is a lot of posturing regarding
interest in reading groups, extensions of seminar, and so on; but very
few who want to make good on the promise that they will read something
together, or offer comments on a work in progress.</p>
<p>There is of course an element of comfortability and community at play
here, and I am not suggesting that everyone ought to be comfortable
reading everything with everyone, or that anyone in particular should be
comfortable reading any particular text with me, of all people. But it
is somewhat surprising that in a graduate body of nearly 3000, at least
a third of which are notionally committed to some form of close reading
as an occupational hazard, it is not straightforward to find others who
want to make time to work through texts. As an undergraduate at
Princeton, I felt much the same. (I effectively failed to start an
extracurricular book club within a group of people who had 'literary'
inclinations.) During a stint working in Silicon Valley, I somewhat
hilariously proposed to read Lampedusa's novel <em>Il Gattopardo</em>
(in the English translation of course) with aspiring tech aesthetes in
an entity titled 'Club Book'. After the first session (7pm after work on
a Monday), it was clear that most attendants' idea of a book club was
substantiated much more by alcohol consumption than it was reading or
discussion. As a researcher working at a human rights research group in
London, I semi-successfully initiated an after-work reading group called
<a href="https://argnotes.club/">A.R.G</a> which ran more than 20
sessions; but even here there were really only one or two other
regularly committed attendees.</p>
<p>The aesthetic of humanities at universities like Brown tells us that
reading, writing, and thinking critically is important; yet the
apparatus of attention around those activities (especially when they are
not directly legitimised by institutions with names, or professors with
titles) is often quite alienating. Perhaps this is a luxury unique to
the Ivy Leagues, which are admittedly the only schools at which I have
formally pursued courses of study. Indeed, many of my best experiences
within these institutions have been with professors or students who have
spent significant time at public institutions, in the U.S. or
elsewhere.</p>
<p>So I spent three or four hours today annotated papers the grades for
which I have already submitted.</p>

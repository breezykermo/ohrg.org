<p>First on the syllabus in Rohit Goel's current <a
href="https://www.bicar.org/rumors-capitalism-conspiracytheories-register">BICAR</a>
course is Mladen Dolar's 2024 book <a
href="https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail?book_slug=rumors--9781509561698">Rumors</a>.
This short book is an extended and adapted version of Dolar's
contribution to the 2022 edited volume <a
href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctv2b8rwxd">Objective
Fictions: Philosophy, Psychoanalysis, Marxism</a>, and in its first
sentence it lays out the topic at hand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To take rumors as a serious object of theoretical scrutiny and
philosophical reflection seems like a contradiction in terms…. [C]an
rumors acquire the dignity of a concept?… If one deals with such an
unworthy and undignified subject, isn't this a sure way to ruin one's
philosophical reputation? <span class="citation"
data-cites="dolarRumors2024">(Dolar 2024, 1)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dolar has become something of a specialist essayist (in what he
writes in English, at least). He published the delectable <a
href="https://aksioma.org/pdf/Mladen-Dolar_Whats-in-a-Name.pdf">What's
in a Name?</a> (which I wrote about <a href="./24-02-29.html">here</a>)
in 2014 as an extended essay associated with an art exhibition at the
Institute for Contemporary Art in Ljubljana, and there is more than a
passing resemblance between this book and <em>Rumors</em>. Both begin by
rhetorically turning Western philosophy on its head. The first sentence
of <em>What's in a Name?</em> is: "It all began with Plato" <span
class="citation" data-cites="dolarWhatsName2014">(Dolar 2014, 6)</span>,
and <em>Rumors</em>, after a brief digression through the winning
explanation of how quantum physicists understand the eerie materiality
of Higgs boson ('the God particle'), takes us to "the Socratic
foundations of philosophy" <span class="citation"
data-cites="dolarRumors2024">(Dolar 2024, 5)</span> in the distinction
between <em>doxa</em> (opinion) and <em>epistēmē</em> (knowledge).
<em>Doxa</em> will come to be associated with rumors over the course of
the book, although it requires important clarifications. Opinions have a
subjective source, someone tracibly responsible for their elocution.
Rumors, on the other hand, distinguish themselves in that they run on
the wind, which is to say autonomously, words that appear through the
grapevine <em>without</em> a source. Rumors are a peculiar kind of
language that circulate socially without a clear cause. Perhaps this is
why, in the part of Vergil's <em>Aeneid</em> that Dolar cites after his
Socratic introduction, "they go around like a breeze of air, stemming as
if from nowhere" <span class="citation"
data-cites="dolarRumors2024">(Dolar 2024, 6)</span>. Rumors are a
substance that appear materially as an effect in the world, but with an
epistemologically (and perhaps ontologically) obscured origin.</p>
<p>So <em>Rumors</em> starts with Socrates, but not directly with his
more respectable philosophical ideas (which we might find in <em>The
Republic</em>, for example), but with the trial that led to his death. A
more serious philosopher might have dismissed this incident as mere
historical 'context' that only bears indirectly on what Socrates has to
tell us philosophically; but Dolar is no such supercilious simpleton.
Following Freud, perhaps– as well as Marx, I can't help but add, another
master of suspicion– Dolar's inquiry is motivated by the idea that often
the most apparently unimportant aspects of a thing are essential to what
is at stake in its essence. Philosophy, Dolar's gesture seems to
suggest, cannot be divorced from its historical situation. As Fredric
Jameson famously quipped, it behooves philosophy to 'always
historicize'.</p>
<p>Crucially, however, philosophy can also not be <em>reduced</em> to a
plain and simple historicization of its actors. Whereas the
identity-political criticism of Socrates might dismiss him as a White
Man philosopher, resultantly disregarding all his ideas as tainted and
thus in need of discarding, Dolar's historicizing approach is not quite
so crass. The more interesting reading of Socrates in the twenty-first
century, Dolar suggests, but to suggest new ways to read what he stands
for rather than castigating the man himself. (The real political impact
of cancelling dead men, white or otherwise, needs some serious thinking
through.) What if Socrates' trial shows us (students of the history of
philosophy and the philosophy of history) the 'first' true triumph of
doxa over episteme, the opening scene of a history of modernity that can
be characterised by the trading of blows between these two sides of the
same coin, of speech/language, of the big Other (episteme) and its
shadow/symptom (doxa)? The history of Western philosophy <em>does</em>
begin with Socrates (we do ourselves worse by denying it), but its
beginning there does not necessarily mean that from that day on, only
White Men can do philosophy. Dolar's reading suggests something similar
to the 'decolonial' reading, i.e. that Socrates inaugurated a particular
tradition of knowledge that has egotistically taken centre stage in the
history of philosophy. But it responsiblizes Socrates in a very
different way, refusing to dismissively cancel him on account of an
inexact identity in favor of a more psychoanalytically generous approach
which sees him both as a subject capable of his own decisions
<em>and</em> as a victim of the times in which he found himself.</p>
<p>Dolar will repeat this gesture with throughout the book with a canon
of other philosophical and literary greats– Vergil (<em>The
Aeneid</em>), Shakespeare (<em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Henry IV</em>, <em>The
Comedy of Errors</em>), Mozart (<em>The Marriage of Figaro</em>),
Rousseau (<em>Confessions</em>, <em>Rousseau Judge of Jean
Jacques</em>), Kafka (/The Trial, <em>The Castle</em>), Cervantes
(<em>Novelas Ejemplares</em>), Gogol (<em>Dead Souls</em>), Kierkegaard
(the Corsair affair), Heidegger (<em>Sein und Zeit</em>), Balzac
(<em>Illusions perdues</em>). The works of each of these figures
inflects the inaugural gesture of Socrates' trial. And it is usually the
lesser considered works, or the lesser considered aspects of well known
works that reveal this inflection. Doxa stalks episteme as its shadow,
conceptually inseparable from it. Knowledge does not work if unfounded
rumor does not cohere a social setting to aspire to it.</p>
<p>The one great literary and philosophical work that Dolar's book
briefly touches on that I want to examine in more detail here, however,
is (<a href="./24-01-26.html">surprise!</a>) Karl Marx's <em>Das
Kapital</em>. Dolar mentions Marx in "a small digression" <span
class="citation" data-cites="dolarRumors2024">(Dolar 2024, 16)</span> in
the section 'Rumors and Capital', which appears between the classics
(Socrates and Vergil) and Shakespeare. Rumor's tempest recalls Marx's
account there, Dolar tells us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An analogy can be drawn with another mighty entity that expands and
multiplies seemingly by mere circulation, namely capital. There, too, we
encounter the expansion of something that starts modestly, then
increases as if through mere circulation, and is amplified into an
overwhelming force, gradually engulfing everything as it goes along in a
potentially limitless process. <span class="citation"
data-cites="dolarRumors2024">(Dolar 2024, 16–17)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may seem like a sophistic nitpick, but I think it is important to
qualify that the homology here should really be between rumors and
<em>value</em> in capitalism. Of course, capital is the name Marx gives
to value in motion, and so Dolar is not exactly wrong to say that we
should see a relation between rumors and capital. But the analogy here
risks suggesting that, just as rumors have haunted our pretensions to a
clear-headed construction of sociality since at least Socrates, capital
too is a sticky symptom that is co-constitutive with sociality rather
than a particular form of social (non-)relation that could theoretically
be done away with. Put differently, by drawing an analogy between rumors
and capital, one risks projecting the apparent trans-historical role of
rumor as an excess or surplus of language that nonetheless coheres the
social fabric (a role for which Dolar makes a convincing case) onto
capital, making it into an essentially trans-historical entity, too.</p>
<p>If we instead refine the analogy that sees rumors ghastly increase
via circulation– ghastly, because it appears to contravene the third law
of thermodynamics, entropy, whereby a value <em>decreases</em> as it
moves– as homologous with <em>value</em>, then capital's stickiness as a
symptom in society doesn't appear as <em>inevitably</em>
transhistorical. Capital's pernicious philosohpical alchemy is to render
a historically specific set of social relations based on property rights
and the wage relation as transhistorically inevitable, to transmute
essentially changeable social customs into apparently natural laws that
misrepresent things 'as they actually are'.</p>
<p>The commodity is Marx's paradigmatic example of this alchemy. In his
infamous example of the dancing table (in the marvelous new English
translation of volume I):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, the table isn't any less made up of wood for having been
worked on, and the wood remains an ordinary sensuous ­thing. But the
moment the­table begins to act as a commodity, it metamorphoses into a
sensuous supersensuous­thing. It doesn't simply stand before us with its
feet on the ground; rather, in its relations with all other commodities,
it turns upside down and spins bizarre notions out of its blocky head,
a­performance far more fantastic than if it were to start dancing of its
own accord. <span class="citation"
data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx 2024,
47–48)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Objects come to appear imbued with the qualities of subjects (living
humans), and contrariwise human laborers appear as if they are just
another input feeding the autonomous subject of capital rather than as
social ends in their own right. Commodity fetishism naturalizes the
historically specific movement of value in capitalism, and makes the
entire set of affairs seem the natural state of things. While Adam Smith
was convinced that man was naturally selfish and thus capitalism an
inevitable social relation, Marx denaturalized both this assumption and
the conceptual system built on that premise in capital in <em>Das
Kapital</em>.</p>
<p>Though he makes out that he will return to the connection between
rumor and capital, Dolar does so only briefly in the final section of
the book, 'The demise of the big Other'. There he takes up Zupančič's
idea of 'conspiracy without a conspiracy theory' to bring capitalism
back into the narrative as "just such a conspiracy without a conspiracy–
a conspiracy that imposes the rule of One that subtends all conflicts
and diversity, but is not orchestrated from the center by some
mastermind?" <span class="citation" data-cites="dolarRumors2024">(Dolar
2024, 111)</span>. (Boštjan Nedoh has evocatively called this idea in
Marx's theory of capital as '<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxJootyFJfU">a theft without a
thief</a>.') Indeed, arguably what makes capital so sticky as a social
relation is its ever-inventive <em>disavowal</em> of any responsibility
for the immiserations that occur and seem to deepen over time according
to it. To transpose this into more Marxian language, what is
philosophically remarkable about value in capital as an entity is that
it structurally covers over its own cause in the sphere of production,
namely the wage relation's appropriation of surplus value from the
worker under the prentense of a 'free and fair' relation. Like rumors,
capital's existence in the world seems to just appear on its own steam,
so to speak, "stemming as if from nowhere" <span class="citation"
data-cites="dolarRumors2024">(Dolar 2024, 6)</span>, as the fetishism at
work in its machinations expropriates agency from human subjects and
plants the appearance of that power in commodity objects. The process of
its circulation covers over its real cause of production (labour) in the
wage relation.</p>
<p>Here lies the real tenet of the homology between rumors and value in
capitalism, I think. Both exist only and because of a lost cause, in a
subject whose ownership of some thing has been disavowed, and so the
phenomenon (rumors or value in capitalism) appears as a thing in itself.
The subject-object relation is distorted, and the truth of the (human)
subject as the object's unconscious cause goes missing.</p>

<h1 class="title">Using NixOS</h1>
<p class="date">27th January 2025</p>
</header>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/breezykermo/nixos">My NixOS
configuration</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For about a year now, the operating system that I use on my daily
driver has been <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1cktkfc/can_someone_explain_nixos_to_me/">NixOS</a>.
I moved to the distribution from Arch Linux, as I was sold on the idea
of having all my dependencies declaratively specified, and thus no
longer having to mess with stateful package management
(<code>apt-get update</code>, <code>pacman -Syu</code>, etc). I was one
or two years into grad school, and off the back of working
professionally with <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> as
declarative infrastructure for cloud systems. How great would it be to
have something similar to provision all the software on a desktop
machine, I reasoned. The rumours that that Nix and NixOS were useful in
theory but prohibitively arcane in practice didn't dissuade me. If
anything, I thought, I would be able to learn more about Linux through
incorporating the ecosystem in my day-to-day life as a grad student<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>These visions of perfect declarative management haven't completely
come to fruition, but they also haven't been <em>completely</em> blown
out of the water. It has taken me a year or so of idly hacking away at
my configuration when I have wanted to install something new to finally
begin to feel as though I have a handle on the language and the
ecosystem. I am still not totally sure what the best resources for
learning more are. Mileage varies in the official documentation, and
there seem to be both a wide range of use cases of Nix, and a wide range
of pareenthetical softwares.</p>
<p>This range of parenthetical software made NixOS especially difficult
for me to adopt, as I was consistently unsure as to whether the
complexity that I was trying to scale was inherent to Nix, or whether it
was embedded in additional tooling that I had unknowingly chose to
adopt. Let me count (a few of) the ways that I feel my NixOS journey was
made difficult.</p>
<h1 id="nixos"><a
href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-installation">NixOS</a></h1>
<p>The first fundamental confusion for me was the boundary between Nix,
the language and package management ecosystem, and NixOS, the Linux
distribution that is configured by way of Nix. It was the idea of NixOS
that drew me to the ecosystem– as I wanted declarative management for my
operating system software specifically– but I realise now that I
probably would have been better to have started off by understanding
pure Nix well and good, and onlymoving to NixOS once I felt competent
there. This is because NixOS works by way of Nix (of course), but there
are also peculiarities of NixOS that one should not confuse with the
peculiarities of Nix. What arguments are passed down to which files in a
modularized NixOS configuration become a lot easier to understand if one
has a clear mental model of how NixOS builds upon Nix.</p>
<p><u>Note to past self</u>: build a good mental model of pure Nix
before hacking together your first NixOS configuration.</p>
<h1 id="home-manager"><a
href="https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml#ch-introduction">Home
Manager</a></h1>
<p>As I built my NixOS configuration by referencing an active
installation of Arch Linux, I made the relatively unconscious decision
early on that I should install softwares at a user level, rather than at
system level. Relatively unconscious, because I am not sure why exactly
I made this decision, and had I thought it through a little more
carefully, I would have realised that this decision also brought an
unnecessary amount of complexity into the picture.</p>
<p>Home manager is a community package<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> for
NixOS that makes it possible to install software in a configuration on a
per-user basis. It also exposes a different and higher level of
abstraction through which to install software than the 'standard'
approach when working in the Nix ecosystem, which is to reference
packages in a repository with Nix-built artifacts, the primary one being
<a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages">Nixpkgs</a>. As an example,
with Home manager one can install the <a
href="https://fishshell.com/">fish shell</a> as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode nix"><code class="sourceCode nix"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>programs.fish = <span class="op">{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="va">enable</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">true</span><span class="op">;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="va">interactiveShellInit</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&#39;&#39;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="st">    set fish_greeting # disable greeting</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="st">  &#39;&#39;</span><span class="op">;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="va">plugins</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">[</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">{</span> <span class="va">name</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;bass&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span> <span class="va">src</span> <span class="op">=</span> pkgs.fishPlugins.bass.src<span class="op">;</span> <span class="op">}</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="op">];</span></span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In addition to the <code>enable</code> option, programs installed
thus also provide a custom set of attributes that are configured via
Home Manager through which one can customize the installation.</p>
<p>One could also, however, install the fish shell directly from Nixpkgs
(in a <code>configuration.nix</code> file) as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode nix"><code class="sourceCode nix"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>environment.systemPackages = <span class="op">[</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  fish</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">]</span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The benefit of Home manager's approach here is the configuration
optionality. In addition to the basic availability of <code>fish</code>
on my system (the result of both approaches), I can also declare a
string that will become its basic <a
href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/language.html#configuration-files">configuration
file</a> (<code>interactiveShellInit</code>) and a list of <a
href="https://arnesonium.com/2022/09/some-great-fish-shell-plugins/">plugins</a>
that will be installed alongside the shell itself.</p>
<p>On one level, this is great: all my configuration is in one place.
Home manager has an <a
href="https://home-manager-options.extranix.com/?query=fish&amp;release=release-24.05">option
search</a> where one can check whether a package exists, and what
options it provides. In theory, if the documentation of options isn't
clear, one can go to the <a
href="https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/blob/release-24.05/modules/programs/fish.nix">module
declaration</a> to try to reverse engineer which option will result in
the desired outcome. In practice, though, I've found it cumbersome to do
this effectively, especially if I'm new to the software in question and
don't have an intimate understanding of its configuration options.</p>
<p>The main issue is that raw NixOS doesn't provide an obvious way to
manage dotfiles. Home manager fills that void by providing a level of
abstraction on top of Nixpkgs that incorporates a sense of the current
user (and hence paths to the user's configuration files); but this
additional level of abstraction is constructed in such a way that it is
not always clear how to map 'configuring new software X based on its
documentation' to 'configuring new software X declaratively in Home
manager'. (This is not even to mention the more complicated case in
which new software X is not supported by Home manager, in which case one
would have to add the new module to Home manager upstream, or work out a
workaround.)</p>
<p>In summary, though Home manager is still useful for me due to its
dotfile management utilities, it confused me early on, as I didn't
always have a clear notion of whether I was installing modules via
Nixpkgs or via Home Manager, and whether a configuration option was
provided by Home Manager or by NixOS.</p>
<p><u>Note to past self</u>: When installing new software, work first
with a basic installation from Nixpkgs before trying to find an
appropriate module in Home manager.</p>
<h1 id="nix-flakes"><a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/flakes">Nix
Flakes</a></h1>
<p>Flakes are kind of like a new version for Nix, much like Python 3 is
when compared to Python 2. The overall use case is the same, but the
tooling is (arguably) better with Flakes, and there are some features
(such as pinned versions in a <code>flake.lock</code>) that you
fundamentally don't have in vanilla Nix without flakes. I personally
adopted flakes when I first started using NixOS for no particularly good
reason; just because they seemed like the 'modern' way to work with Nix,
a recipe for getting in over one's head with the Nix ecosystem, as has
come to be the central theme of this post. As with Home manager, I don't
regret the decision to use Flakes exactly, as I do think that they were
and are useful for my use case. Like Home manager, however, choosing to
adopt them steepened the learning curve in a way that probably could
have been avoided had I had a better sense of <em>why</em> they were
useful for me.</p>
<p>I think of flakes as essentially a different and more integrated way
to write Nix configurations. They're not actually fundamentally
necessary for my NixOS configuration, as its not primarily a 'library'
that is intended to be used by others: it's really just a standalone
software that serves a purpose for me. Where flakes come in handy for me
is when I am writing Nix files in association with particular coding
projects, where I want a development environment, a build process, and
some set of artifacts that are produced from the project. For more on
how NixOS with Flakes works in this context, I refer the reader to the
excellent section of the open source book <em>NixOS in Production</em>,
``<a
href="https://github.com/Gabriella439/nixos-in-production/blob/main/manuscript/BigPicture.md">The
big picture</a>".</p>
<p><u>Note to past self</u>: don't use flakes with your NixOS
configuration; learn about them afterwards and apply it to dev
environments.</p>

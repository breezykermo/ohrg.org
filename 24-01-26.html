<p>The first of these is the most generic. 'Writing in general' is how I
refer to musings that don't expect any particular interest or
specialization of the reader. They are designed to be broadly readable
and digestible to anyone.</p>
<p>The remaining tags or 'streams' require a bit more explanation. As a
third-year graduate student in MCM at Brown (see <a
href="24-01-25.html">here</a> for more context), I have composed and am
reading three separate lists of books and articles. Each of these lists
represents a field of thought in which I want to participate, giving
them the name 'fields lists'. In many graduate degrees, fields lists–
and the fields examination that one sits as their culmination– are
determined by faculty or the department, as the passing of the exam is
supposed to represent a shift in one's status from being a PhD
<em>student</em> to being a PhD <em>candidate</em>.</p>
<p>This terminology is somewhat particular, I believe, to the U.S. 5-8
year PhD model. Students entering the U.S. PhD are not generally
required to have a Masters degree, as a transitional Masters is achieved
in the first 2-3 years of a PhD, during which period the student takes
classes and assists in teaching. Around the three-year mark, students
properly elect their PhD's focus, select advisors, and move away from
taking classes in an exploratory mode toward researching and writing
parts of the dissertation proper. Adam Tooze, in an episode somewhere in
his <a
href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ones-and-tooze/id1584397047">Ones
and Tooze</a> podcast, describes the difference between the U.S. and the
U.K. upper ed model as similar to the distinction between getting street
food at a bazaar and fine dining with a multi-course meal. In the U.S.,
PhD students are expected to select from a smorgasbord of academic
possibilities– represented by faculty across different departments– in
their first few years; whereas in the U.K., students' work is examined
by faculty-qua-food-critics. It is certainly interesting that in one
half of this analogy, students are the gastronomers; whereas in the
other, they are comestibles themselves.</p>
<p>The graduate program in <a href="https://mcm.brown.edu/">MCM</a> is
built in the image of students as gastronomers par excellence. Not only
are we entitled to select our own advisers, we are also given the option
to conjure our own fields lists. These two freedoms go hand-in-hand, in
a sense, as a major constraint on how one can compose a list is whether
or not it will be possible to find a faculty member who will advise on
it. The fields examination in MCM is a three-hour affair,
interview-like, during which one's advisers 'assess' a student's
literacy in the list's contents. The form and intensity of this
assessment depends largely on the temperament of one's advisers.</p>
<p>My primary adviser is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Copjec">Joan Copjec</a>, with
whom I have a list titled: <strong>The Question of Science in
Psychoanalysis</strong>. Though I have only become seriously interested
in psychoanalysis recently– in the last academic year, through the
influence of friends and in taking a class with Joan– it is quickly
coming to be something of a backbone in my dissertation's inquiry.
Whereas it is easy to misrecognize psychoanalysis as a lascivious
enterprise bent on locating illicit sexual thoughts as the underbelly of
all conscious life, it is in actual fact a rich philosophical tradition
that critically inflects a range of staid attempts to reckon with the
complexities of human life without accounting for desire in any way.
Philosophy from a psychoanalytic standpoint works to think through the
world equipped with notions such as the unconscious, drive, desire, and
so on; all of which gesture towards the opacity of certain elements in
the human subject and its civilizations. More on these particulars
later, no doubt.</p>
<p>My first list's project is to study the question of <em>science</em>
in psychoanalysis: two terms that have a troubled and intimate relation
to each other. Freud infamously thought himself a man of science, and
painted psychoanalysis as a scientific enterprise.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> If
this characterisation is curious to the 21st century imagination, it is
because "science" has been imagined as an undertaking in cold, hard,
objective fact. The psychoanalytic bestiary of dreams, repression, and
sexual fantasy is forcibly held at a distance from the safe havens of
rationality, logic, and science: because to admit a permeable lining
between the two would be to threaten the security of one's
conclusions.</p>
<p>My first list is interested in this lining exactly. Jacques Lacan– a
philosophical reader of Freud to whom we will certainly return–
reportedly designated the psychoanalytic enterprise a calling card at
the doorstep of Science, capital S. The premise of psychoanalysis as a
philosophical project– that rationality's ghosts cannot simply be
banished, but haunt the whole kingdom of thought and action– is a
critique of the commonplace scientistic doctrine that everything, in
principle, can (eventually) be known.</p>
<p>My second list is with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Szendy">Peter Szendy</a>, and
is titled: <strong>The Question of Dialectics in History</strong>. The
scope of this list is, in some ways, much easier to explain than the
first: by way of it, I want to cultivate an understanding of Marx's
adamantine three-volume book, <em>Capital</em>. My focus in this
gargantuan task is on the status in that work of what will come to be
theorized (later in the 20th century with Freud, Lacan, etc) as the
psychoanalytic subject. In terms more germane to Marxian literature, I
am asking about the status of subjective <em>freedom</em> in Marx's
thought in general, and in the philosophical project of capital in
particular. (There is a dimension of overlap between this list and my
first on psychoanalysis which addresses work written at the interface of
Marx and Lacan; these two names both acting as stand-ins for the
philosophical projects of the critique of political economy and
psychoanalysis respectively.)</p>
<p>My third and final list is with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suresh_Venkatasubramanian">Suresh
Venkatasubramanian</a>, and is titled: <strong>The Question of
Mathematics in the 20th Century</strong>. It consists chiefly of names
such as Alan Turing, Gödel, Von Neumann, and other early 20th century
mathematicians who built the conceptual basis for the emergence of the
discipline of computer science. This list will be, I think, something of
the substance of the main course in my actual dissertation: the expected
confection that comes out of all this degustation. The idea is to write
some thoughts on the question: what is the relation between computing
and capital, in the 20th century and now? Has it changed since the
emergence of the computer's concept, or is it structurally the same?
What bearings can such an undertaking provide (if any) for the critical
apperception of the place of the computer in society today?</p>

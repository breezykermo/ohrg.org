From January 2021 - June 2021 (6 months).

Roughly tracking the [Brown spring
semester](https://bulletin.brown.edu/academic-calendar/).

Research will step week-wise, tracking content and assignments from various
courses.

Looking to school up in four primary fields, with a fifth (deep learning)
partially covered both by way of computer vision and the practical FA work I'll
be doing with mtriage.

# Linux!
Now running [artix](https://artixlinux.org/) as my daily driver. Among other
things, this will get me more in tune with the internal management software in
linux (artix doesn't use
[systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/), on the basis
that it is too complicated, not stable or secure). My PID 1 is
[runit](http://smarden.org/runit/).

My main aims in continually customizing linux are to:
1. Learn how linux and computers in general work more practically
2. Really thoroughly enjoy working on my computer
3. Get in the habit of scripting repetitive tasks and writing software for
   myself on a regular basis.

A subsidiary goal is to recreate my academic setup (working with PDFs,
annotations, etc) so that it runs entirely on linux.

# Computer Vision.
Auditing [CSCI 1430: Introduction to Computer Vision](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1430/).

> fundamentals of image formation, camera imaging geometry, feature detection
> and matching, stereo, motion estimation and tracking, image classification,
> scene understandings, and deep learning with neural networks.

The course trackes [James Hays](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/)' course (as he used to be assistant professor at Brown).

Assumes linear algebra, data structures, and Python (assignments are all in Python).

#### Refreshers 
- [linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) [refreshers](http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html)
- [numpy refresher](https://stackabuse.com/numpy-tutorial-a-simple-example-based-guide/)
- [basic probability](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/)
- [image kernels](https://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/)
- [distill (ml)](https://distill.pub/)

#### Textbooks
- [Concise Computer Vision: an introduction into theory and algorithms](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b7269614).
- [Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications](http://szeliski.org/Book/).
- [Dictionary of computer vision and image processing](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b7121510).


# Distributed Systems.
[CSCI 1380](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs138/s20/index.html) - undergrad
course in go.

Doing this unofficially (don't want to overwhelm myself with obligations that
I can't live up to).


# Operating Systems.
- https://www.redox-os.org/
- https://os.phil-opp.com/multiboot-kernel/

TODO: schedule a study plan of these both that accords with the Spring
semester.

# Deep Learning / Data Science
Perhaps foolishly asked if I might audit [DATA 2040](https://data2040.github.io/) also.

This would be a good opportunity to get some practical experience in
Tensorflow, and to properly understand reinforcement learning. Plus to get in the good books with DSI.

Also must:
- Run through FastAI book, end-to-end.
- Come to start reading papers regularly.
- Find news feeds for Arxiv and other papers.

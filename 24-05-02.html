<p>Today's log discusses two projects, Svitlana Matviyenko's and Sarah
Pourciau's, as a follow on from <a href="24-04-24.html">the last
log</a>.</p>
<h1 id="svitlana-matviyenko">Svitlana Matviyenko</h1>
<p>I came to Matviyenko's work through <a
href="https://www.iwm.at/event/garrison-colony-and-soviet-atomgrad">an
event here at the IWM</a>, which took place this past Friday. She is
currently an <a
href="https://www.sfu.ca/communication/people/faculty/svitlana-matviyenko.html">associate
professor at Simon Fraser University</a> (SFU) in the School of
Communication, and she was previously (I seem to remember, although I
cannot now find the Internet proof of this) an assistant professor in
NYU's department of <a
href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/departments/media-culture-and-communication">Media,
Culture and Communication</a>. Both of these departments/institutes are
at the forefront of a particular kind of media theoretical critique in
the American academy; though like many American things it has something
of a European and global reach. <a
href="https://www.sfu.ca/communication/people/faculty/wendy-chun.html">Wendy
Chun</a>, who used to be a professor in <a href="24-01-25.html">my
department</a>, received a big grant to kick-start SFU's <a
href="https://digitaldemocracies.org/">Digital Democracy Institute</a>
circa 2020, and ever since has surely played some kind of instrumenetal
role in bringing together an impressive range of up-and-coming names in
critical accounts of computing (<a
href="https://www.sfu.ca/communication/people/faculty/stephanie-dick.html">Steph
Dick</a>, for example– <a
href="https://www.sfu.ca/humanities-institute/about/profiles/a-toscano.html">Alberto
Toscano</a> is also currently visiting faculty there).</p>
<p>Matviyenko did her dissertation with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Dyer-Witheford">Nick
Dyer-Witheford</a>, a scholar who is best known for his first book,
published in 1999, <em>Cyber Marx: Cycles and Circuits of Struggle in
High-technology Capitalism</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="dyer-withefordCyberMarxCyclesCircuits1999">(Dyer-Witheford
1999)</span>. Matviyenko's dissertation is titled <em>Lacan's
Cybernetics</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="matviyenkoLacanCybernetics2015">(Matviyenko 2015)</span>,
and attempts to track the relationship between Lacan's presentation of
psychoanalysis across his seminars (which took place annually between
1953 and 1981) and cybernetics, an intellectual movement/field of
thought whose first wave is typically traced to circa 1948, the year in
which Norbert Wiener published <em>Cybernetics: or Control and
Communication in the Animal and the Machine</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="wienerCyberneticsControlCommunication2019">(Wiener
2019)</span>, and which is generally understood to have had a second
(1960s), third (1990s), and sometimes even a fourth wave (2010s?) in the
ensuing years.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Lacan knew about cybernetics: he first treats
the subject explicitly in his second seminar (1954-55). Though this
seminar has come to be known as his cybernetic seminar, Matviyenko makes
a convincing case that one there is development of the ideas in seminar
II, in at least seminars III, XI, and XX. Matviyenko's contextualization
of Lacan's position on cybernetics is extremely useful, even if the
specificity of an argument beyond contextualization is at times hard to
make out. Her dissertation's general task is to "contextualize Lacan's
work in the variety of debates on cybernetics" <span class="citation"
data-cites="matviyenkoLacanCybernetics2015">(Matviyenko 2015,
27)</span>, and to situate "the cybernetic episteme" as an influential
discourse in and on Lacan's thought. This argument consists of what I
find a confusing kind of historicism, i.e. through a set of claims that
pose cybernetics as a Foucauldian episteme which "serves as the framing
for knowledge upon which psychoanalysis operates" <span class="citation"
data-cites="matviyenkoLacanCybernetics2015">(Matviyenko 2015,
43)</span>.</p>
<p>I find this confusing as a methodological stipulation in relation to
Lacan's seminars because the figure of the Foucauldian episteme seems to
me very much in tension with a 'Lacanian' notion of 'discourse', of
tracing cause and effect in the language of Lacan's seminars. For
example, Matviyenko's summary of her method in chapter 1 is as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To summarize: the cybernetic episteme organizes the subject of
science's relation to knowledge as the mechanism of blackboxing
maintained by the institutional power formed within certain conditions
of mediality. <span class="citation"
data-cites="matviyenkoLacanCybernetics2015">(Matviyenko 2015,
43)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To start, there are a number of terms in this summary that need
elucidation. This sentence comes after a section that present the basic
context of terms such as communication, control, and homeostasis in
their cybernetic formulations, and in the section preceding this summary
the Lacanian notion of the "agency of the letter" <span class="citation"
data-cites="matviyenkoLacanCybernetics2015">(Matviyenko 2015, 41)</span>
has been mapped. I understand Matviyenko's claim to be meaning to say
something to the effect of: cybernetics' presentation of the world as
nothing but traceable cause and effect, i.e. its behaviorist and
scientistic basis, is an intellectual basis upon which Lacan's idea of
the agency of the letter, as well as his related presentation of the
notions of 'repetition automatism' and 'the subject of science', can be
developed. Yet Matviyenko confuses this point in the quotation above by
introducing an idea of 'blackboxing' (a term not properly developed at
this stage, nor later in the dissertation) and by suggesting a hazy
relation to 'institutional power'.</p>
<p>In other words, Matviyenko's attempt to chart the relationship
between cybernetics and psychoanalysis by way of Foucauldian
'archaeology' results in a mystification of the specificity of her
historical claim, preferring instead to lean on Latourian/Foucauldian
language of mediality and power in a way that I find obscuring rather
than enlightening. Throughout the dissertation, she wants to suggest
that there is something Lacan's thought shares with/inherits from
cybernetics– an unproblematic claim in its generality, given the
aforementioned direct treatment Lacan gives to cybernetics– but I have a
hard time making out what exactly the substance and consequence of this
relationship is in Matviyenko's view. Though ample context is provided
about Lacan's views on automatism and cybernetic notions of the subject,
the strongest kind of claim Matviyenko herself makes is so generally
media-theoretical that it seems barely to be a claim at all: i.e.
"psychoanalysis reflects contemporary conditions of mediality" <span
class="citation" data-cites="matviyenkoLacanCybernetics2015">(Matviyenko
2015, 54)</span>, or "[Lacan's] thought seems to be caught in the
changing condition of mediality" <span class="citation"
data-cites="matviyenkoLacanCybernetics2015">(Matviyenko 2015,
55)</span>.</p>
<p>Whatever one can critique in the historicist flattening of
argumentation, though, it is undeniably still very rich on context. The
dissertation's second chapter, "The Subject of Science", is particularly
useful for me in this regard, as it lays out the connections from
Norbert Wiener's thought to Leibniz and Pascal, as well as Dutch
mathematician and astronomer Christiaan Huygens (working and writing in
the 1650s), and putting these references in relation to Lacan's
conception of modern science (via Alexandre Koyre) and automatism (via
Descartes). Matviyenko convincingly posits both cybernetics and
psychoanalysis as taking up the challenge of "the model of the body as a
system-coupled-with-the-environment that transcends Cartesian mind-body
dualism" <span class="citation"
data-cites="matviyenkoLacanCybernetics2015">(Matviyenko 2015,
78)</span>: that is, the problem of the subject in science, of the
material/ideal dialectic, of thought's relationship to the world at
large (read: ontology, epistemology, phenomenology). It seems clear to
me that psychoanalysis should be seen as a <em>critique</em> of
cybernetics (rather than, as Matviyenko seems to see it, as a
complementary or comparable system of thought, similar in the sense of
similarly deficient and perspectival)</p>
<p>Chapter three, "Freud's circuitry", is similarly rich in its
presentation of determinism and thermodynamics as influences on Freud's
thought. Lacan's notion of <strong>structure</strong> is then traced as
the sublimation (to use Freudian vocabulary, rather than Matviyenko's)
of Freud's reckoning, and the apparent allusions to Claude Shannon's
concept of error in Lacanian repetition automatism. The relevance of
these 19th century discoveries on psychoanalysis is clear and
undeniable, and again my main quibble of the dissertation's method would
be in that Matviyenko doesn't do much argumentatively with this context
other than provide it. Though perhaps I should not be so quick to judge
such an argumentative lack, as the text is certainly immensely valuable
as a reference for further study (which is perhaps all one should ask of
a dissertation).</p>
<p>A slightly more substantive claim is reached by the end of the text;
namely that "both psychoanalysis and cybernetics belong to the epoch of
<em>graphocentrism</em>, which began in the nineteenth century and
extends to the present moment" <span class="citation"
data-cites="matviyenkoLacanCybernetics2015">(Matviyenko 2015,
193)</span>. In making this claim, Matviyenko gestures to the ongoing
relevance of cybernetics and psychoanalysis to contemporary ideologies
and epistemologies of science and the subject, and I certainly agree on
this point. Chapters 5 and 6 offer an intriguing tour of more recent
theorizations (Kittler, Latour, Foucault, Didi-Huberman, Florian Cramer,
Alex Galloway) in an attempt to link graphocentrism with what is seen as
its current instantiation as <strong>interpassivity</strong>. There are
many names and theorists in these two chapters (as there are in the
earlier ones too, I suppose), and I again find myself somewhat confused
by the blur of terms: a "dialectic relation between the modalities of
extension and prosthesis" <span class="citation"
data-cites="matviyenkoLacanCybernetics2015">(Matviyenko 2015,
172)</span>, "parasitic passivity" (with reference to Michel Serres),
and the ultimate argumentation that today's interpassive subject has
"lost meanings and practices of solitude, of sensations of mild joy"
<span class="citation"
data-cites="matviyenkoLacanCybernetics2015">(Matviyenko 2015,
190)</span>.</p>
<p>I don't necessarily dispute these claims, but I am suspicious of the
idea that our 'digital condition' is something distinctly different from
some previous historical/social condition, when attention was more
integral, and desire not quite so distorted. Or at least, I am yet to be
properly convinced by an argument in this vein. Perhaps it is just my
dormant computer utopianism, instilled in me by a formal education in
computer science, which will not allow me to believe that computers
render us necessarily more distracted, alienated, or less capable of
freedom than what came before. But I still can't quite stomach this
media-theoretical kind of thinking that slaps new terms on new
conditions and figures it critical. Something I need to work through, I
think.</p>
<p>I had wanted to also briefly touch on Matviyenko's most recent book,
co-authored with Nick Dyer-Witheford <span class="citation"
data-cites="dyer-withefordCyberwarRevolutionDigital2019">(Dyer-Witheford
and Matviyenko 2019)</span>; but it will suffice to say at this point
that I was similarly underwhelmed by the theoretical effects of this
'psychoanalytic' and Marxist conception of cyberwar. I am not sure that
I feel the stakes of the theorization– not in material-political terms,
as it is obviously evident that the term 'cyberwar' denotes something
perverted and violent going on at global scale– but in the sense that I
am not sure what more I understood about it through the reading of this
book. Again: perhaps this is a function of a shallow kind of reading on
my part, and it might benefit me to work through it again at a later
stage.</p>
<h1 id="sarah-pourciau">Sarah Pourciau</h1>
<p>I have not considered Pourciau's project as extensively as
Matviyenko's, as I have only read one recent essay of hers in Critical
Inquiry titled "On the Digital Ocean" <span class="citation"
data-cites="pourciauDigitalOcean2022">(Pourciau 2022)</span>. This
essay, in contrast to Matviyenko's writing, I found something of a
revelation. It sees something problematic in the discourse on
'digitality' in the comparison of data to the ocean, and marks this
problem as one that stretches far beyond the historically
'computational' per se into the reaches of philosophy that feminizes and
passivizes matter, posing the mind as a master of the seas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the book of Genesis through the twentieth century, the oceans of
the past figure the feminine matrices of divine and human creation, the
wombs and tombs of the earth, the fertile yet deadly milieu of the
sirens and the mermaids. They are figures of endless flux and fecund
formlessness, and thus of infinitude, in the oldest sense of <em>what
cannot be fenced in or finished</em>. <span class="citation"
data-cites="pourciauDigitalOcean2022">(Pourciau 2022, 234)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem of the digital ocean, in other words, for Pourciau is an
age-old problem of conceptualizing infinity. A certain computerized
conception of the world wants to render it totally calculable,
atomizably "composed of distinct digits (0s and 1s), which is to say
that it is remainderlessly divisible into discreet bits, which is to say
that it is per se accessible to the logic of conceptual definition and
analysis" <span class="citation"
data-cites="pourciauDigitalOcean2022">(Pourciau 2022, 235)</span>. One
ideology of digitalization, in other words, is that it flattens ontology
into epistemology. Everything is knowable "as a digital sea of quantum
bits" <span class="citation"
data-cites="pourciauDigitalOcean2022">(Pourciau 2022, 235)</span>, and
thus there is no part of the world that is not conceptually,
hypothetically, available to know. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Pourciau goes on to give, in the course of some thirty pages, an
enormously erudite review of set theory's impact on the philosophical
conception of infinitude, covering Cantor in the first section and
Turing/Gödel in the second. The major consequence of this review is to
call into question the ontologizing of a 20th-century mathematical
conception of infinity: As the essay concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turing's implicit thesis is that the countable set of computables is
big enough–as big as an ocean, even, albeit not an <em>apeiron</em>–and
the question we need to ask and answer in response is: Big enough for
what? We will have a better chance of making headway on this problem, I
think, if we stop calling on the remainder of Woman to do the work for
us. <span class="citation"
data-cites="pourciauDigitalOcean2022">(Pourciau 2022, 261)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an explicit thread in this essay from these mathematical
notions of infinity to Lacanian and post-Lacanian thought ("the
remainder of the Woman"), and thus I believe Pourciau's project will be
extremely relevant to mine.</p>

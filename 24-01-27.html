(chapter 2)</h1>

<div class="main-content">
<!-- Filter buttons will be inserted here for index.html -->
<p>Into the deep end: today I prepared a chapter of Rebecca Carson's
<em><a href="https://brill.com/display/title/63249?language=en">Immanent
Externalities: The Reproduction of Life in Capital</a></em>. This book
emerged through her dissertation work with Etienne Balibar, and it is a
work of incredible precision apprehending and extending the conceptual
system in Marx's <em>Capital</em>.</p>
<p>One way to understand the book's project is to see it as a response
to <strong>post-Marxism</strong>, a school of thought that posits Marx's
critique of political economy in <em>Capital</em> as in need of some
kind of fundamental update so as to be relevant to 20th and 21st century
social life. Post-Marxism holds that some event (or set of events) has
taken place since Marx wrote <em>Capital</em> that jeopardise one or
more of the core principles in his system. Financialist post-Marxists,
for instance, see the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard">demise of Bretton
Woods</a> as a historical moment that effectively uprooted capitalism in
some way; and there are doubtless 'crypto post-Marxists' who see/saw the
invention of Bitcoin as a similarly disruptive moment. Technological
post-Marxists argue that capitalism has transformed into something else
(something worse, usually) through a technological 'revolution' of some
kind. (This position is nowhere better summed up in the title of
Mckenzie Wark's 2019 book <em><a
href="https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/887-capital-is-dead">Capital
is Dead: Is This Something Worse?</a></em>. This is a book I have not
yet read: but <a
href="https://homintern.soy/issues/3-22-20/capdead.html">these</a> <a
href="https://cosmonaut.blog/2020/10/12/worse-than-dead-a-critical-response-to-mckenzie-wark/">two</a>
[scathing] reviews in partnership with the very expressive title make it
hard to imagine that Wark's position is anything other than the picture
of technological post-Marxism.)</p>
<p>The post-Marxist position in technology studies is, I would argue,
much more mainstream than value-theoretical approaches. This is perhaps
an ontological hazard of the disciplinary orientation of 'technology
studies' as such, in that 'technology' is assumed to represent a
fundamentally distinct consistency in the world (that can be uniquely
studied). The assumption that technology 'today' consists of something
fundamentally 'modern', i.e. distinct and evolved with respect to its
pre-modern counterpart, is commonplace; perhaps because of the
widespread belief the electronic computer effected a critical shift in
the logic of societal composition at some point in the mid-20th century.
The phrase 'information revolution' is not only corporate pamphleteering
for senseless restructuring and redistribution of wealth: it also
denotes the tacit assumption at work in much 'technology studies'
scholarship that the stuff of computers is <em>not</em> the stuff of
other things we call technology (such as hand tools, steam-powered
machines, etc). Computational sociality is something for which Marx
could not have accounted, the common, post-Marxist wisdom asserts: for
he was not writing <em>Capital</em> at a keyboard; was not writing
Engels email; was not editing his writing with generative language
models; and so on.</p>
<p>Carson's book is much more addressed to the financialist
post-Marxists, however, than their technological <em>mon frères</em>.
Her overall thesis is that <strong>fictitious capital</strong> (a term
she takes from the French post-Marxist critical economist <a
href="https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/320-fictitious-capital">Cédric
Durand</a> to refer to the appearance of surplus value that emerges in
financialised flows of money traded for other money) is
<em>immanent</em> to the production component– that is, his
value-theoretical argument– in Marx's <em>Capital</em>. More precisely
and poetically, for Carson <em>fictitious capital fills in the gap of
dead times in the production process</em>. Unlike the post-Marxist
position, which sees in financialised capital a premise for sunsetting
Marx's value-theoretical approach, Carson's re-reading and
re-theorisation of Marx seeks to systematically link the proliferation
of financialised flows to the movement of value that 'originates' in the
production process, i.e. in the production of commodities by way of the
wage relation between capitalist and worker.</p>
<p>Though I have read sections of the book before (chapter 2, "Money
Form", in particular, which I used for a term paper in early 2023 to
recognise <a href="http://matteopasquinelli.com/">Matteo Pasquinelli</a>
as technological post-Marxist by way of Carson's critique of the Italian
Operaismo approach to the gold standard), today's focus was chapter 3,
"Fetish Character". Like the rest of the book, this chapter is dense,
precise, and difficult. (That this book was essentially Carson's
dissertation is humbling and intimidating.) The first section, 2.1,
argues that the movement of value in Marx should be understood with
reference to its Hegelian foundations, and that "interest-bearing
capital" (money breeding money, financialised flows) constitutes a
particular value form in capital that is intimately related to the other
value forms, namely wage (surplus value from the worker-capitalist
relation) and rent (surplus value from land ownership). The second
section, 2.2, goes on to clarify (and critique) Marx's use of the
terminology 'person', and to recognise a fundamental relationship
between capital's <strong>impersonal</strong> forms of domination (such
as the commodity) and its <strong>personal</strong> forms (such as the
contract). Essential to Carson's argument is that while impersonal forms
are historically specific to capital(ism), its <em>personal forms of
domination are not necessarily</em>, and as such can occur in other
modes of production such as feudalism. Seeing personal forms of
domination as immanent to their impersonal mirrors is a cornerstone of
Carson's argumentation throughout the book, and represents her chief
rejoinder to the post-Marxist complaint that 'capital is dead'.</p>
<p>In re-reading this chapter, my project became to draw out the
development of three related yet distinct characterisations of capital,
all of which figure in <a href="24-01-26.html">my attempt to chart the
computer-capital relation</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Capital as <strong>abstract</strong> subject</li>
<li>Capital as <strong>autonomous</strong> subject</li>
<li>Capital as <strong>automatic</strong> subject</li>
</ol>
<p>These characterisations represent waypoints in Carson's development
of her (Hegelian) understanding of the movement of value, as well as her
insistence on reading out of Marx a <strong>monetary theory of
value</strong>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Capital operates as an abstract
subject because it is independent ('abstract') from the will of those
engaged in exchange. It is not a concrete, sensuous object, nor is it an
evanescent, fictive ideology in the minds of exchangers.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The
status of capital as an abstract subject can be understood with respect
to the essential Marxian theory of <strong>abstract labour</strong>.
Abstract labour is a notion that represents the measurement of some kind
of concrete, particular labour by way of socially necessary labor
time.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> It is because the commodity is
valued by way of abstract labour that is a sensuous-nonsensuous thing; a
'notion' that "exists neither at the level of being, nor at the level of
immediate objectivity" <span class="citation"
data-cites="carsonImmanentExternalitiesReproduction2023">(Carson 2023,
78)</span>. Carson argues that value moves abstractly, i.e. in this
reflected/refracted realm of neither objectivity nor subjectivity. The
Marxian economist Alfred Sohn-Rethel famously referred to this kind of
notion as a <strong>real abstraction</strong>– and I recommend <span
class="citation" data-cites="toscanoOpenSecretReal2008">(Toscano
2008)</span> for a good introduction to the philosophical stakes of this
term.</p>
<p>It is value's abstraction in this sense that makes capital also an
<em>autonomous</em> subject. As Carson puts it: "Value is a social
relation that is 'autonomous and dominant'"<span class="citation"
data-cites="carsonImmanentExternalitiesReproduction2023">(Carson 2023,
79)</span>. (Abstract) value moves by itself. Not for the sake of the
human subject involved in its exchanges, but for its own sake as
subject. When capital is dominant, "accumulation and the reproduction of
value are the driving force of the process"<span class="citation"
data-cites="carsonImmanentExternalitiesReproduction2023">(Carson 2023,
80)</span>. Human life is nothing but an object instrumentalised to
service the life (reproduction) of capital's forms. The movement of its
things (commodities) takes place autonomously, on its own, without the
(conscious) control of individuals (humans). Capital as autonomous
subject, in other words, services its own needs– the accumulation and
reproduction of value– not the needs of the humans that happen to be its
constituents.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Capital is an automatic subject in a slightly different sense still.
Carson has an <a href="https://www.animateassembly.org/capital/">entry
in the Animate Assembly project</a> which goes into the meaning of this
term specifically: but the basic idea is hopefully already clear from
the previous characterisations. Capital automates out the place of the
(human) subject, replacing it with the inhuman drive (greed) for surplus
value. Moreover, its autonomous movement takes place 'automatically';
that is, <em>without the trace of its genesis in the measurement of
abstract human labour in the sphere of production</em>, exclusively at
the apparent level of circulation. It is here that capital's status as
automatic subject sheds light on Carson's sophistication of the
post-Marxist account: capital <em>wants</em> to appear as no-longer-just
capital, as financial flows untethered from its productive underbelly,
as this mystification is at the heart of its autonomy and
abstraction.</p>

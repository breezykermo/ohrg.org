<h1 class="title">Writing Academic Essays</h1>
</header>
<div class="main-content">
<!-- Filter buttons will be inserted here for index.html -->
<p>As an undergraduate student in the US, I feel like I never properly
learned how to structure an academic essay. This was no doubt partially
due to my being a bad student who never asked the right questions; but I
do think that there is something in the structure of an
interdisciplinary liberal arts education in the U.S. in the 21st century
that regretfully avoids giving students strong guidelines on how to
write a coherently argumentative essay. The following are a set of
principles that influence how I have come to write essays– which is to
say that they might be totally inadequate for many forms of writing, and
don't necessarily stand up as guidelines for getting writing accepted
anywhere for publication. They are rather my own reflections on what I
have come to see as 'good' academic work, i.e. work that I find valuable
and meaningful in its own right, regardless of where/how it is
published.</p>
<h1 id="have-a-thesis-statement">Have a thesis statement</h1>
<p>This is an almost brazenly obvious point, but it continues to
surprise me how much writing I read where I cannot seem to make a clear
argument out. A thesis statement is a sentence that can be formatted as
an 'I argue that…' phrase. There are good arguments (defensible,
well-evidenced, offers some bearing on something important) and bad
arguments (unfalsifiable, shoddily evidenced or under-substantiated,
apparently correct but unimportant).</p>
<h1
id="each-section-and-paragraph-of-the-essay-should-service-your-argument">Each
section and paragraph of the essay should service your argument</h1>
<p>If the relationship between a paragraph or section of your essay to
your thesis statement is not clear, then you should provide orienting
notes so that the reader can follow along. For example, 'In order to
show that [argument], it will be instructive first to look at [content
in this section] to establish [the basis for a dimension of the argument
that I will go on to outline]'. Tidbits or references that are not
directly in service of an essay's argument should either go to a
footnote ('Though it does not bear directly on my argument here, …'), or
should not be included in the essay.</p>
<h1 id="start-with-a-clear-presentation-of-one-concept-or-object">Start
with a clear presentation of one concept or object</h1>
<p>A thesis statement is often composed of terms or objects that the
essay will mobilize in a particular way. It is important to show your
reader how you understand these terms, a demonstration that can but
doesn't necessarily need to reference theorists or texts that use the
term in similar ways to how you understand them. For example, if your
argument is that 'cycling shoes are a commodity that epitomize late
capitalism', it is normal and perhaps advisable to structure your essay
according to a progressive unpacking of the terms in your argument: 'I
first define cycling shoes as a variant of shoe that first appeared in
the 60s… I then indicate that a commodity is an exchangeable object by
way of Marx's theory of the commodity in <em>Capital</em>… and finally I
argue that late capitalism started in the 70s and persists until today'.
A writing advisor once told me that all good essays in both undergrad
and grad school are simply extended detailings of singularly enigmatic
terms ('late capitalism'), and I am not sure that they are wrong.</p>
<h1 id="dont-try-to-predict-the-future">Don't try to predict the
future</h1>
<p>I don't know if it is the increasing instrumentalization of the
humanities by 'the sciences' in service of solving their ethical
conundrums or something else in the academic air, but predictive
arguments about the future seem on the rise. Arguments of the structure
'I argue that [X] will happen because [Y]' are generally on shaky ground
(I would argue). Even if you are convinced that you know how something
will play out, it is almost always better to temper the tone of your
argument to something a bit more moderate, i.e. 'I argue that [X
historical or philosophical concept] reveals something important about
the [current situation of Y]'. Admittedly, this tempered format is less
falsifiable, as it doesn't presume to know what <em>will</em> happen
next in some area of social life. But if you want to write an essay that
will withstand the test of time, you should be <em>very</em> careful
about what straightforward predictions you make.</p>
<h1
id="provide-the-reader-with-insight-they-would-not-obviously-get-by-reading-your-essays-sources">Provide
the reader with insight they would not obviously get by reading your
essay's sources</h1>
<p>This is the difference between an essay that simply represents other
arguments and one that makes its own. Representing and interpreting
other arguments is an important part of academic writing, and you should
not shy away from doing the work of explaining how you understand
another text or writer in your essays. Often this is the most important
work in an essay, i.e. showing the reader how you understand other
texts. But your argument should not be a simple addition of the texts
together (argument X + argument Y = my argument). You should rather
provide the reader with something that they could not obviously get
simply by reading your sources; i.e. to show that a dimension of
argument X can be better understood by taking into consideration the
claims in argument Y.</p>
<h1
id="dont-assume-that-the-reader-is-familiar-with-the-textssources-you-are-discussing">Don't
assume that the reader is familiar with the texts/sources you are
discussing</h1>
<p>Good writing does not assume that a reader has read the texts and
sources under examination carefully. Rather, it shows the reader the
important aspects of these texts through careful interpretation in
service of an argument. If my argument is that Freud's method of
interpreting dreams allows us to read tweets as emanations of the
unconscious (an argument of which I would be highly suspicious), you
should not assume that your reader has read Freud or has any clear
notion of what he means by the unconscious. You should rather present a
reading of what you understand Freud to mean when he talks about the
unconscious in service of showing its relevance to tweets.</p>
<h1
id="a-greater-number-of-citations-doesnt-always-amount-to-stronger-evidence">A
greater number of citations doesn't always amount to stronger
evidence</h1>
<p>Citations are an important part of academic writing, as they show
that your argument is situated within a body of work and that you are
not writing 'off the cuff' with no idea of what has previously been said
about your object or subject. But citations should also be employed
judiciously. As a general rule of thumb, if you do not go on to offer a
direct interpretation of a sentence in terms of its structure or word
choice, then it is almost always better to paraphrase the original point
(while still providing the appropriate page reference from which you
drew it). Paraphrasing is a form of interpretation; it shows how you
understand a text or object, and what you see as important about it for
the sake of your argument. You should <u>not</u> drop in extra citations
for the sake of it, or simply to show that you know about the existence
of a text or book (except occasionally in a footnote, if you want to
flag that some text exists but is not being addressed or bears some
tangential relevance to your argument).</p>

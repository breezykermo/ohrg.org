<p>Today's project was completing Jacques Le Goff's 1990 <em><a
href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780942299151/your-money-or-your-life">Your
Money or Your Life: Economy and Religion in the Middle Ages</a></em>.
This book offers a prehistory of capitalism in the medieval figure of
the <strong>usurer</strong>. The usurer is a person who lends money at
interest in order to collect that interest at some point in the future
and make a profit. From the 10th through 13th century, the usurer was "a
necessary but detested man, powerful but also vulnerable"<span
class="citation" data-cites="legoffYourMoneyYour1988">(Le Goff 1988,
10)</span>.</p>
<p>Le Goff sees the prefiguration of capitalism in the (Christian)
moralisation of the usurer as a sinner. He also sees "the beginnings of
psychological modernity"<span class="citation"
data-cites="legoffYourMoneyYour1988">(Le Goff 1988, 12)</span> in the
manner in which usurers, amongst other sinners, were able to perform
confession and/or contrition for their sins, often at their deathbed, to
escape damnation in Hell or Purgatory. The plausibility of the usurer's
escape from damnation despite the Church's condemnation of usury in
general as one of the worst kinds of sins is what gives this book its
title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To save himself, must [the usurer] forsake his pouch? Or will he find
– or will someone find for him – a way to hang onto both his money and
his life, his eternal life? This is the usurer's great struggle, a
struggle between wealth and Heaven, between Money and Hell. <span
class="citation" data-cites="legoffYourMoneyYour1988">(Le Goff 1988,
15)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This book is on my list because it paints an important picture of the
usurer in medieval (pre-capitalist, feudal) imagination. It avoids
economic analysis for the most part, besides remarking in the first
chapter that the ecclesiastical status of money is the source of the
usurer's fundamental characterisation as a sinner <span class="citation"
data-cites="legoffYourMoneyYour1988">(Le Goff 1988, 18–20)</span>,
preferring to attempt to understand the Church's condemnation of usury
on its own terms. The figure of the usurer is closely linked the the
figure of the Jew during the Middle Ages, Le Goff argues, as while the
bible more or less unequivocally condemns usury among one's own
'countrymen', lending money to foreigners is permitted as a sort of
necessary evil for the functioning of society. Thus the Jew, in its
consideration the exhaust of Christian society – not part of its 'whole'
but rather its ghostly excess (it is compared with the figure of the
mistress, illicitly sought after yet consciously repressed) – is the
only societal role for which usury is 'permitted'. This point is
important, I think, for understanding Marx's argument in his early essay
"On The Jewish Question" <span class="citation"
data-cites="marxJewishQuestion2014">(Marx 2014)</span>.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The status of usury in medieval thought contributes to a prehistory
of capitalism in that, in (the transition to) capital, usury is elevated
from sinful to almost saintly. Capital's objective is to accumulate
value and reproduce itself, and usury (interest-bearing capital) is one
way in which it does this.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In the Middle Ages,
however: "Usury is the unlawful surplus, the illegitimate excess….
[U]sury is more than a crime, it is a sin…. first and foremost a theft"
<span class="citation" data-cites="legoffYourMoneyYour1988">(Le Goff
1988, 26–27)</span>.</p>
<p>The mechanics of usury's condemnation are effectively inverted by
capital's emergence as autonomous subject. Whereas in feudalism, "it is
against nature for money to be loaned to give birth to more money" <span
class="citation" data-cites="legoffYourMoneyYour1988">(Le Goff 1988,
29)</span>, in capitalism the movement of financialised value is
fundamentally <em>naturalised</em>. The Church condemns usury because it
unceasingly works, offending God by being endless and automatic.
Capital, on the other hand, adores it for this very same reason; it
displaces the human as subject (and renders God effectively dead, a la
Nietzsche).</p>
<p>In further resonance with the role it will play in capitalism, usury
is accursed under feudalism because <em>it is a theft of time</em>.
(Chapter 3 is titled "The Thief of Time".) Usury does not produce
surplus (interest) through any kind of production, i.e. through
vegetables sprouting in the land or value added in combining materials.
Rather, the cause of its surplus is only the (synthetic) production of
time: "the time that elapses between the moment [the usurer] lends the
money and the moment he is repaid" <span class="citation"
data-cites="legoffYourMoneyYour1988">(Le Goff 1988, 39)</span>. What is
the problem here, for the Christian imagination? Le Goff reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time, of course, belongs solely to God. As a thief of time, the
usurer steals God's patrimony. <span class="citation"
data-cites="legoffYourMoneyYour1988">(Le Goff 1988, 39)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be interesting to think further regarding which qualities of
the usurer have carried from the Middle Ages to modernity (its ruling
silently from the shadows <span class="citation"
data-cites="legoffYourMoneyYour1988">(Le Goff 1988, 51)</span>, for
example); and which have been re-moralised as 'saintly', or otherwise
un-sinful. Has the shame associated with the money-lender become an
artificial pride? The secular nature of capitalism certainly no longer
has the guts to denounce working all day and night, instead striving to
reproduce this zombie-like existence in its human vassals. More on this
secular automatism in future logs.</p>

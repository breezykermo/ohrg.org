<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Today I worked properly through the first chapter of Zizek's
<em>Sublime Object of Ideology</em> (towards an essay I am currently
writing, outlined at the top of <a href="24-02-28.html">this log</a>).
I've reported before on the introduction (<a href="24-02-05.html">this
log</a>), and the opening of the first chapter (<a
href="24-02-07.html">this log</a>) - in the latter of which I outline
Zizek's homology between both the (Marxian) critique of political
economy and the (Freudian-Lacanian) project of philosophical
psychoanalysis, and also the more particular similarity between the
commodity and the dream which serves as a starting point for stitching
those two projects together. Here I want to work more closely through
the rest of the chapter, in which Zizek elaborates from the
commodity-dream correspondence to argue for a <strong>value-desire
correspondence</strong> These two 'systems' of Marx and Freud
respectively are <strong>movements</strong> that articulate for Zizek an
excess or <strong>surplus</strong> at work; a surplus that illustrates
why Lacan conjures the idea of 'surplus-enjoyment' as an evocation of
the Marxian 'surplus-value'. This pedagogical move of explicating Lacan
via Marx (as well as some other thinkers, such as Hegel, Sloterdijk,
Kafka, Althusser) takes place repeatedly throughout this chapter to
introduce the reader to a collection of psychoanalytic concepts -
symptom, hysteria, fantasy, transference - that will ultimately service
Zizek's grander argument about <strong>ideology</strong> in the book as
a whole. Recall that the pedagogy of Lacan's system and sense is one of
the threefold aims of the book that Zizek details in its introduction.
In addition to re-actualizing Hegel and contributing a critical theory
of ideology, it aims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to serve as an introduction to some of the fundamental concepts of
Lacanian psychoanalysis: against the distorted picture of Lacan as
belonging to the field of 'post-structuralism', the book articulates his
radical break with 'post-structuralism'; against the distorted picture
of Lacan's obscurantism, it locates him in the lineage of rationalism.
<span class="citation"
data-cites="zizekSublimeObjectIdeology2009">(Zizek 2009, xxx)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For my part, the homology between psychoanalytic desire and Marxian
value is useful, because it lays the foundation of how to think about
the capture and closure of desire in capitalism; the condition of
unfreedom that its logic of production and circulation engenders; and
the structural illusion that this capture generates in the apprehension
of computing's artifacts.</p>
<h1 id="sohn-rethel-as-a-reader-of-marx">Sohn-Rethel as a reader of
Marx</h1>
<p>Zizek's first move is to read Marx through <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Sohn-Rethel">Alfred
Sohn-Rethel</a> in a subsection titled "The unconscious of the commodity
form", as Sohn-Rethel is seen as the best theorist of the surplus at
stake in the Marxian commodity-form; and thus the best reader of Marx to
link his work to Lacan. Sohn-Rethel's theory of <strong>real
abstraction</strong> operates as a critique of the Kantian
transcendental subject, in that it undermines the plausibility of an a
priori frame of knowledge, an objective gaze through the fantasy of
which so-called <strong>scientific knowledge</strong> (knowledge that
straight-forwardly 'exists' without accounting for its subject-position)
comes into being. Sohn-Rethel's thesis is that <em>money is the formal
'cause' of transcendental consciousness</em>. This thesis is a
"disquieting fact" <span class="citation"
data-cites="zizekSublimeObjectIdeology2009">(Zizek 2009, 11)</span>,
because it proposes that the foundation of our clear-headed
(transcendental) consciousness is the something essentially external;
namely the strange social operativity of <strong>money</strong>. The
idea that our <em>internal</em> state of mind is contingent upon
something partially <em>external</em>, i.e. socially mediated, is what
justifies the name 'real abstraction'. <em>Abstraction</em> - internal
thought, which appears to us as transcendent, in the sense that it seems
to have no cause but itself - is in fact contingent upon something
<em>real</em> - an external consistency not ultimately subject to our
will as such. This real consistency, in capitalism, is money: or rather,
the exchange relation for which money serves as the embodiment.</p>
<p>Sohn-Rethel's reading of Marx expedites the point that Zizek wants to
make regarding the connection between Marx and Lacan, as it sets up the
theorisation of <strong>value</strong> in Marx as akin to Lacanian
<strong>desire</strong> in the critical sense that both operate through
an absence / immanent exception in their own logic. The name given to
such a structure, which operates through the logic of its own immanent
exception, is (and this language is used directly by both Marx and
Lacan) <strong>surplus</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="marxian-surplus">Marxian surplus</h1>
<p>To properly consider the homology that Zizek is proposing, one needs
to cultivate both an understanding of the status of surplus in the
Marxian philosophy of value on the one hand, and the basis of the
relationship between the unconscious and desire in Lacan on the other.
Let's return to Marx and Sohn-Rethel - and try to provide a bit more
pedagogical context than Zizek does - to work towards the first of these
understandings. In volume one of <em>Capital</em>, Marx infamously does
not introduce the notion of money until he has first fleshed out a firm
concept of the commodity, its value (in both use-value and
exchange-value), and the presentation of a relationship between a
commodity's value and labour (in both its concrete and abstract
modalities). Why? Because money is a commodity whose value resides only
in the exchangeability of commodities as such. Without first
understanding that a commodity represents a thing, service, or affair
that is subject to exchange - and that the value of a commodity as
universally exchangeable is measured in the quantity of abstract labour
that resides in it - we would have no bearings through which to
understand the meaning of money in a capitalist system of exchange.
Money <em>materialises</em> this exchange relation in its status as that
exceptional commodity whose use-value is as the measure of
exchange-value in itself, i.e. as the signature of the exchangeability
of all other commodities as such.</p>
<p>Value in Marx is a structure that substantiates the social bond. It
is, in other words, the logic that undergirds how humans relate to each
other, the very substance of society. Marx's claim in <em>Capital</em>
is that society is increasingly configured around a particular
<em>movement</em> of value, a movement which he calls capital. In the
capitalist interpretation of value, things / services / affairs are
commodified - that is, their value is temporarily reduced to just one
aspect of itself, exchange-value, in order to circulate on the market as
a commodity. The use-value still exists in objects of our consideration;
but in its form as a commodity, the gravity of a thing's use-value is
wholly overshadowed by the glamour of its exchange-value. Recognising
money as the embodiment of exchange-value, we can summarise this point
in a much more apparently simple way: 'in capitalism, everything wants
to have a price'.</p>
<p>The word 'wants' here is of critical importance. It is not the case,
as is often assumed, that we can simplify this summary to state instead:
"in capitalism, everything has a price". For it is not true that
<em>everything</em> has a price in capitalism, nor that price
(exchange-value) is always and everywhere the sole measure of value in
the structure of society. This word 'wants' inserts a distance between
the <em>appearance</em> of value as exchange-value in the commodity, and
the <em>reality</em> of value that saturates the thing, service, or
affair. In capitalism, value has an inclination towards being expressed
as exchange-value, even though it is in reality a 'quality' more
capacious that is not solely reducible to its measurement in money.</p>
<p>Capital as a structure is distinctly characterised by this
inclination to reductively render value one-dimensionally in and as just
one of its proportions, exchange-value. This reduction should be
considered both its means and its ends. Insofar as it takes place,
capital has achieved its cardinal 'desire': it has gotten what it
'wants'. Capital strives towards this self-satisfaction, and the more
dominant the structure of capital is in society, the more urgent,
necessary, and natural this drive appears - even though it is, in
reality, a historically contingent kind of social relation.</p>
<p>Capital's drive to render value as exchange-value is the mechanism
one must keep in mind to properly understand the Marxian critique of
<strong>surplus-value</strong> Marx wanted to understand: what about
capitalism drives us to continually ramp up the production of
commodities and to invest in those particular kinds of technological
innovation that bolster this phenomenon? How, in the production and
circulation of commodities, is an additional amount of exchange-value
conjured (as if from nowhere), and how does it come to line the pocket
of a particular role in this process - a role Marx will come to call
that of the capitalist? Where, in the apparently free exchange of
commodities between producer and consumer, does this sleight of hand
take place, a sleight that keeps 'the economy' on its ever-upward
trajectory?</p>
<p>Surplus-value is the Marxian name for the telos of capital, the
object which it lacks, and therefore towards which it must therefore
strive in search of satisfaction, the absent cause that it uses to drive
its subjects to perpetually produce.</p>
<p>As the end-it-itself of capitalist accumulation, surplus-value
acquires a quasi-mystical status. The set of reductions or
mischaracterisations that suffuse capital as a mode of production are
all oriented towards it - value is but exchange-value, labour is but
labour-power, things are but commodities - <em>so that</em> there may be
surplus-value. Each of these reductions is the mystification of a
subjective <em>measurement</em> so as to appear as an objective
<em>principle</em>; a fundamental obscuring in the production of
surplus-value that Marx calls <strong>fetishism</strong>. Surplus-value
in Marx, then, is a kind of transcendent quality, something that appears
as if from nowhere through the mechanics of fetishistic reduction that
take place in the capitalist mode of production.</p>
<h1 id="lacanian-surplus">Lacanian surplus</h1>
<p>The quasi-mystical status of surplus-value as the absent yet driving
force of capitalist production and accumulation in Marx's analysis is,
Zizek suggests, the logic through which the qualifier 'surplus' comes to
figure in Lacan's theorisation of <strong>surplus-enjoyment</strong>.
Surplus-value's absence conjures the drive for ever-more of it (effected
through the production and circulation of the commodity). Value in its
capitalist configuration cannot exist without surplus-value as its
absent cause and its telos. Desire, Lacan argues, shares the same
structure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we subtract the surplus we lose enjoyment itself, just as
capitalism, which can survive only by incessantly revolutionizing its
own material conditions, ceases to exist if it 'stays the same' <span
class="citation" data-cites="zizekSublimeObjectIdeology2009">(Zizek
2009, 54)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>embodiment</em> of the missing cause and end of desire's
system, its surplus-enjoyment, is what Lacan calls the <strong>objet
petit a</strong> - the object-cause of desire. Surplus-value in capital
is a 'thing' that can never quite be possessed, and this ever-absence is
what drives the movement of value in the production and circulation of
commodities. When the immanent limit of value's system is positivised as
something to be sought after - when surplus-value is materialised in its
'reality' as more-and-more money - capitalism acquires its drive to
permanent development. A similar drive, what we might also call a
<strong>bad infinity</strong>, results when we misapprehend desire as
something that can be achieved, or finally satisfied. It is rather
something negative, something missing, that drives both desire and value
to reproduce themselves.</p>
<p>This negative (absent) cause, the common missing that paradoxically
inaugurates the very systems that lack in it, is why Lacan credits Marx
for inventing the <strong>symptom</strong>, in Zizek's reading. The
symptom is the name for an effect in which one can interpret something
missing, a paradoxical crack in the systematicity (of value or desire)
that reveals the system's fetishistic drive towards something outside of
itself, its mis-rendering of the subject-object dialectic as something
simpler and less entangled than it really is.</p>
<p>Thus it is Sohn-Rethel's reading of Marxian value as a logic of the
subject-object dialectic's fetishistic disavowal that makes clearer the
connection between psychoanalysis and capitalism. Lacan's evocation of
Marx in surplus-enjoyment recognizes that the satisfaction of sexual
desire might, like capitalist accumulation, be compromised in the sense
that, though it seems to seek an end outside of itself, its teleology is
really servicing nothing more than its own reproduction.</p>
<p>For Zizek, this correspondence serves to illuminate Lacan's project
as political, for Marx's philosophy has long been the best and most
uncontroversial example of a truly political philosophy.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Yet
it also illuminates something important about Marx's project; namely
that while it does an excellent job diagnosing the logic of capital, it
does not offer the reader a strategy through which to work from within
it to overcome it. Zizek's wager is that psychoanalysis offers us a
better version of this roadmap.</p>

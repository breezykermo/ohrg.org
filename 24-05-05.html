<p>Re: <a
href="https://mackbooks.co.uk/products/uneasy-listening-notes-on-hearing-and-being-heard">Uneasy
Listening: Notes on Hearing and Being Heard</a>:</p>
<p>This book is a captivating and succinct introduction to what I find
important and interesting about psychoanalysis, and maybe Lacanian
psychoanalysis in particular. Grose's generous explanations/ruminations
of/on the psychoanalytic endeavor are jarring in contrast to Brewer
Young's type-written, "laconic", and abstract sections. In the final
dialogue, I could 'feel Grose's self-consciousness regarding her
too-assumed role as analyst in her words, in the fractured attempt of
this collaborative masterpiece.</p>
<p>The figure of a technically 'correct', scientific listening seems the
substance of the strange desire Gore expresses to write this book in its
beginning (for it would be hard to deny that, however collaborative a
book might be, we can't but conceptualise its authorial beginning
somewhere singular: and it is appropriately - laconically - the woman
who inevitably bears this burden. But yeah - what a masterclass in the
art of conversation. I was peeved at the beginning upon reading in that
Grose "wrote him [Brewer Young] a letter asking if he would like to work
on a very small book" <span class="citation"
data-cites="groseUneasyListeningNotes2022">(Grose and Young 2022,
8)</span>, as I thought: "she surely only wrote him an email." Having
read the book now, and having learned how Brewer Young inexplicably
(laconically) wrote his sections on a type-writer, I am willing to
revise the force of my "surely". It seems the kind of retroaction in
which this pair of writers might indeed actually engage.</p>
<p>I was also initially annoyed by the flirtatious finish to his [Brewer
Young's] short starting letter; "the Lacanian likes of you, Anouchka, I
felt, even more than felt, that your toolbox contained things that are
acute, raise, and gentle" <span class="citation"
data-cites="groseUneasyListeningNotes2022">(Grose and Young 2022,
9)</span>. I bet she's pretty, this Anouchka, and young. Did Robert say
yes to the project through some projection of desire, wanting to be nice
and agreeable ("collaborative"), but secretly harbored some purposive
hope to linger on her mind? This was a cruel and suspicious thought, I
think now, even if it is or was partially true.</p>
<p>And then Anouchka's flirty response on October 17th! "I'm not sure
how cut out I am to be a vampire. Vampires don't seem particularly
interested in reciprocity and consent. I've invited Robertâ€¦"<span
class="citation" data-cites="groseUneasyListeningNotes2022">(Grose and
Young 2022, 41)</span>. I surely can't be the only one who reads this as
a thinly veiled reference to <em>Twilight</em>. Which would mean that
Anouchka is flirting with the idea that she might not be cut out to be
Bella?! Or maybe I am: and so the thorough embarrassment I feel in
coming to this Jacobian-reading is really a suspicious madness; and I
should find someone (or something) to treat it. I won't be able to stop
myself looking up these people later today (once I have Internet), and
checking in on the current status of their relationship to each other.
Lovers? Friends? Something disastrously in between? You don't close a
collaborative book project with a walk in a graveyard unless something
sexual is going on, surely.</p>
<p>On a more academic note, I was surprised and charmed to read in
Grose's first letter "A Short History of Psychoanalytic Listening" an
account of Weizenbaum's <em>ELIZA</em> and the spectre of
machine-automated therapy. Locating the analyst's listening as somewhere
between the "too-much" of giving into counter-transference/instinctively
recoiling from it (Josef Breuer and Anna O) and the "too-little" of the
non-existent interlocutor (<em>ELIZA</em>, and now mindfulness apps)
seems a beautiful way to frame the precarious problem of
subjectivity.</p>
<p>I learned some, too, about what it looks like to be a clinical
Lacanian. That you don't believe in bringing a patient around to some
constitutional reality (which makes sense, knowing in what I do of the
impasse of the Lacanian Real); that you work in some shared art of
fantasy to manufacture this surreal place of free association. That in
practice most analysts flout Freud's suggested mandates regarding the
analysand's appropriate level of education, "fair reliable character"
<span class="citation" data-cites="groseUneasyListeningNotes2022">(Grose
and Young 2022, 66)</span>, not being in states of confusion, and not
being too old. (Although Grose doesn't explicitly repudiate this last
one. Maybe she does tend toward younger patients.)</p>
<p>I also agree with Katherine Angel's assessment on the back cover of
the book that it is often funny, as it made me laugh on several
occasions. For example, the "Conscious and Unconscious Bias" section
(Grose's, little surprise): "When public figures rush off to get their
unconscious racism sorted we probably all know what it's like to smirk a
little." <span class="citation"
data-cites="groseUneasyListeningNotes2022">(Grose and Young 2022,
24)</span>; "This is why strangers sometimes run away from analysts at
parties; they think you'll be some smart alec who can see immediately,
and will tell them, that they want to fuck their mum or kill their
sister." <span class="citation"
data-cites="groseUneasyListeningNotes2022">(Grose and Young 2022,
25)</span>; or: "In a paper called "Analysing, Not Psychoanalysing": he
[Bernard Apfelbaum] writes about how to interpret without being a jerk.
In this sense it a very important paper" <span class="citation"
data-cites="groseUneasyListeningNotes2022">(Grose and Young 2022,
28)</span>. Brewer Young is less funny, I would say. Though I did find
it funny how unfunny he is in contrast to Grose, which is not
necessarily something I think he wouldn't recognise.</p>

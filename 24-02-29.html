<div class="main-content">
<!-- Filter buttons will be inserted here for index.html -->
<p>Today I'll report on Mladen Dolar's 2014 essay "<a
href="https://www.aksioma.org/pdf/Mladen-Dolar_Whats-in-a-Name.pdf">What's
in a Name?</a>" <span class="citation"
data-cites="dolarWhatsName2014">(Dolar 2014)</span>. I read this essay
recently in preparation for a session in a series on the subject of
naming. Earlier in this series, we read the chapter "Che Vuoi?" from
Zizek's <em>Sublime Object of Ideology</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="zizekCheVuoi2009">(Zizek 2009)</span>; Dolar's essay
responds to and develops Zizek's chapter (which I will look to address
in a future log), 25 years later.</p>
<p>After the misquoted opening frontispiece of Shakespeare's Juliet,
professing from her hypothetical balcony, to one "Janša" rather than the
expected "Romeo", the essay opens with a commonplace idea in philosophy:
"It all began with Plato" <span class="citation"
data-cites="dolarWhatsName2014">(Dolar 2014, 6)</span>. Yet Dolar's
Plato is not read principally through his <em><a
href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-ethics-politics/">Republic</a></em>,
but rather a relatively obscure dialogue called the <em><a
href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-cratylus/">Cratylus</a></em>.
As the SEP entry on the latter notes, this lesser known dialogue is
vexing in part because "[i]t is not clear how its main topic - the
correctness of names - is connected with Plato's other philosophical
concerns" <span class="citation"
data-cites="meissnerPlatosCratylus2023">(Meißner 2023)</span>.</p>
<p>So for Dolar Plato is the beginning (perhaps predictably) of the
philosophical question of names - but Dolar's Plato is heterodox, as
principally the enigmatic author of the <em>Cratylus</em>, rather than
the orthodox investigator of ethics and politics as author of the
<em>Republic</em>. Moreover, in Plato there is "[t]he specter of Juliet
on the balcony" <span class="citation"
data-cites="dolarWhatsName2014">(Dolar 2014, 7)</span>; a stroke painted
with a broad brush in that a the shadow of a connection across several
thousands of years, between Plato and Shakespeare, is tauntingly
proposed through the mutual concern for the status of a name ("rose") in
relation to the thing, a rose in the flesh.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Dolar's theory of names will propose that there is a
necessary shadow of a thing introduced by a name, "an x, which is an
ineffable being without properties, a nothing which nevertheless appears
as something" <span class="citation"
data-cites="dolarWhatsName2014">(Dolar 2014, 31–32)</span>. Such a
necessary shadow complicates a theory often misassociated with the
orthodox Plato, namely the allegory of the cave. (This is in fact a
theory espoused by Socrates in the <em>Republic</em>; Plato is simply
playing the stenographer.) In this allegory, Socrates presents the role
of the philosopher as one who perceives the higher reality of the
objects that motivate the shadows on the wall, shadows that prisoners in
the cave do not even necessarily know are shadows. As per <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave">Wikipedia</a>:
"The shadows represent the fragment of reality that we can normally
perceive through our senses, while the objects under the sun represent
the true forms of objects that we can only perceive through reason." For
the Socrates in this conception, reason is capable of attaining to the
forms of things, essentially subtracting the mirage of shadows (our
senses) from their indexical source to ultimately apprehend the 'real'
reality behind them.</p>
<p>Dolar's approaches the issue with this conception of the philosopher
without addressing it directly, through the problem of the origin of
names that is thematised in Plato's <em>Cratylus</em>. If there are to
be names that we consider 'more true' than others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there must be an essence which the names must spell out…. Names are
like tools that we need to get to this essence, and there can be tools
that are more or less appropriate, and hence have a varying degree of
truth or falsity. But these tools are not quite freely ours to choose,
or to select better ones from, for the names are always given by some
Other, the rule-setter, the law-giver, the name-maker. <span
class="citation" data-cites="dolarWhatsName2014">(Dolar 2014,
8)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This problem, of course, could be analogised to the shadows in
Socrates' cave. Which shadows (appearances, names) are more proximate to
the essence than others? How do we, as prisoners of language and our
senses, adjudicate the truth and falsity of each?</p>
<p>If there is to be an essence, argues Dolar, there must be some
substance 'beyond' language, an actual 'value' that lies beneath the
referential index of the shadow-games of names. In this setup, as Dolar
notes in the quote above, one has to chase this value, through index
after index, back to some original law-giver, an original Other. The
reference to an "Other" here is, of course, an invocation of that term
in Lacanian thought, whereby it represents the necessary exception to
thought that points to something existing outside it, within it - what
Lacan also refers to as its <strong>extimate</strong> quality. (For an
introduction of sorts to the idea of thought's necessary incompleteness
in the Lacanian tradition, see <a href="24-02-05.html">24-02-05</a> on
Zizek.) This originary law-giver also evokes Freud's myth of the
<strong>primal father</strong> in <em>Totem and Taboo</em> <span
class="citation" data-cites="freudTotemTaboo2001">(Freud 2001)</span> -
a myth that Lacan reinterprets as a structural detail in the logical
composition of language as such. See <a
href="https://www.nosubject.com/Father">this entry</a> on nosubject.com
for an entrypoint into the Father and related Lacanese.</p>
<p>Though I cannot dive deep into the details of this myth and Lacan's
presentation of it here, suffice it to say that Dolar's account here of
the problem in names evokes a constellation of Lacanian ideas about the
structure of language and its relation to the subject as a position
within it. (There is, of course, also the section later in Dolar's essay
regarding Freud's naming strategy as a father, further evidence of the
crypto-Lacanian sense at work here.) Joan Copjec has detailed the way
that this problem relates to the Lacanian theory of the subject
magnificently in the chapter titled "Cutting Up" in her 1994 book,
<em>Read My Desire: Lacan Against the Historicists</em> <span
class="citation" data-cites="copjecCutting2015">(Copjec 2015)</span>.
Copjec shows how Lacan and psychoanalysis offer an answer to a paradox
not unrelated to Dolar's problem of a name's first nomination: namely
Zeno's paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise. (Zeno's paradox is a
problem preserved, much like Socrates' problem of the cave, through a
prominent Greek philosopher - thought in this case that philosopher is
Aristotle rather than Plato.) From the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)">Atlas</a>sian <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise, Achilles is in a
footrace with the tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a head start of
100 meters, for example. Suppose that each racer starts running at some
constant speed, one faster than the other. After some finite time,
Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's
starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter
distance, say 2 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to
run that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced
farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the
tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere the
tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even
reach the tortoise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer that Copjec finds in Lacan to this paradox is ultimately
the same answer that Dolar proposes in the infinite regression of
name-givers: the perspective on the problem, the "I" in the picture,
must produce an <code>x</code>, ineffable and irredicible to any
summarisation of properties, a negativity which carves and cuts up the
problem's sensibility as straightforward; a contradiction that marks
thought's and language's <em>necessary incompleteness</em>. As Copjec
argues, it is this "cutting off of the subject from a part of itself…
[that] accounts for the cutting up of the subject's movements" in Zeno's
paradox <span class="citation" data-cites="copjecCutting2015">(Copjec
2015 p.??)</span>. There is always a <strong>doubt</strong> that is
produced by language, for it can never be completely sure of itself, and
it is the absence of this surety (not a positive something) that
<strong>desire</strong> perpetually seeks. Dolar's term for this absence
that produces desire is <strong>ghost</strong>, or specter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is thus with every name. No name without a specter. Naming is
evoking a phantom, conjuring a ghost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The specter of this essay, as I noted at the top, is Juliet on the
balcony, reflecting on her predicament as a Capulet fallen in love with
a Montague. What better name for desire than this scene, the substance
of a rose's value in question?</p>

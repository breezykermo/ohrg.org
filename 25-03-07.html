<p>Up first today, some notes from chapter 21 of Marx's
<em>Capital</em>, volume I, his chapter on <em>Simple Reproduction</em>.
I returned to this text (in its <a
href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691190075/capital">new
translation</a>) at a writing retreat in Connecticut over the weekend.
After sharing a work-in-progress regarding the outline of a theory of a
subject in Marx, it was sagely pointed out to me that, in order to
really convince a reader that such an outline exists, I should really
show its substance in Marx's own writing. Up until this point, my
argument has been constructed around instructive 'secondary sources'
such as Moishe Postone's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time%2C_Labor_and_Social_Domination">Time,
Labor and Social Domination</a> and Alfred Sohn-Rethel's <a
href="https://brill.com/display/title/26580?language=en">Intellectual
and Manual Labour: A Critique of Epistemology</a>, both of which are
book-length interpretation of <em>Capital</em> by lifelong scholars of
Marx. These two texts will remain key interlocutors in my argument's
construction, but I cannot only channel Marx's Geist solely through
second-hand accounts of him.</p>
<p>My hesitancy to interpret Marx's text directly comes out of an
abiding bias absorbed from the academic atmosphere which suggests that
it is 'old news' to retrace interpretative grooves that have already
been clearly marked out. I have come to disagree quite strongly with
this opinion, as it misses the real value of textual interpretation,
which is not primarily to produce new knowledge from undiscovered
sources, but to work through language and thought in and against the
temper of a new time. But the 'innovation exhortation' nonetheless
haunts me, aspiring as I am in part to American academic success, as one
is expected in this climate to produce something new and newly useful.
It is much easier to argue for the newness in an interpretation of an
object not yet interpreted than it is to justify yet another
interpretation of well-trodden territory like Marx's <em>Capital</em>.
In the latter case, one also has to be sure that one is not offering as
'new' an interpretation that has in fact already been offered in the
literature. In Marx's case, there are some two hundred years of
interpretation in almost every language imaginable. How can one be sure
that yet another interpretation is 'new'?</p>
<p>One can't, in short. It is impossible to read all the relevant
literature. It is impossible even to read most or a significant portion
of it in the case of Marx-related studies. This is one of the ways in
which the vocabulary of scientific discovery falls short in textual
interpretation. The <em>value</em> of interpretation is not always
surfacing something hitherto unknown to an imaginary readership that has
already read everything hitherto published. The fantasy of such an
academic production is not only an impossible task, but it also has a
fantasmatic audience. No-one is perfectly literate in this exhaustively
imagined way! A better objective, I am coming to realize, is to
synthesize something for a significant portion of readers that is not
yet readily visible. Thus I am turning my attention to re-reading Marx's
<em>Capital</em>, as it seems to me that there is much that has been
'lost' to the zeitgeist regarding this text's critical value, even as it
is nominally the most common coin in contemporary critical-theoretical
projects.</p>
<h1 id="simple-reproduction">21: Simple Reproduction</h1>
<p>(In the older translations, this is chapter 23.)</p>
<p>David Harvey notes that this chapter zooms out from has preceded it
in volume I in terms of analytic perspective:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The analysis so far has been concerned solely with the production of
surplus-value as a one-shot event. But things look rather different when
examined as a continuous process ongoing over time. <span
class="citation" data-cites="harveyCompanionMarxsCapital2018">(Harvey
2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this stage in <em>Capital</em>, a reader has been made familiar
with key concepts such as commodity <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>, money <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>, value, labour-time and so on, and
the movement of value has been atomistically conceptualised in slices
such as <span class="math inline"><em>M</em> − <em>C</em></span> (a
purchase), <span class="math inline"><em>C</em> − <em>M</em></span> (a
sale), <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em> − <em>C</em> − <em>M</em></span> (the
capitalist equation) and <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em> − <em>M</em> − <em>C</em></span> (the
consumerist equation). These are all expressions of moments in the
entangled processes of the production and circulation of value as
analytically captured by Marx. These forms of appearance are critical
terms; but they are also "phenomena that conceal the inner working of
[capital accumulation's] mechanism" <span class="citation"
data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx, Roberts, and Brown
2024, 520)</span>.</p>
<p>Along with the conditions of production (and circulation) come
conditions of <em>re</em>-production. Reproduction is the sphere of
activities that are not consciously counted in capital's calculus and as
such cannot appear to matter in the context of its logic. Marx's
argument in <em>Capital</em> is that capital is a synthetic totality, by
which I mean to say that though it is self-consciously totalizing– that
is, it appears to itself as fully accountable– in reality it represses a
range of moments that are actually the unconscious foundation of its
character.</p>
<p>The big elephant in the room here is <em>labour</em>. Capital
considers labor as a relatively unremarkable input that contributes to
its valorization process in production and circulation. The capitalist
starts with some money; he uses it to purchase variable capital
(labor-time) and fixed capital (machinery) to kick off the production of
some commodities; and when he sells those commodites he skims the
surplus value off the top that has naturally been generated by his
bringing those pieces of capital together to work in cooperation. Marx's
project thus far has been to logically reconstruct and conceptualize the
elements of this production process so as to show that there is
something problematic about this 'natural' interpretation of the process
of accumulation, and that something is the way in which labour gets
measured as a contribution to the surplus value returned.</p>
<p>Thus Marx locates the <em>logical</em> beginning of capital's
valorization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The purchase of labor-power for a certain amount of time initiates
the production process. The initial moment recurs when the time is up,
and a production period of a certain length has come to an end, whether
a week, a month, or longer. But the worker isn't paid until after his
labor-power has produced its effect, realizing in commodities both its
own value and surplus-value…. The labor that the worker performs next
week or next month will thus be paid for with the labor he performed the
previous week or the previous month. <span class="citation"
data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx, Roberts, and Brown
2024, 522)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The worker necessarily advances his labor-time as a commodity to the
capitalist due to the temporal structure of the <strong>wage</strong>.
This advancement is the logical beginning of the production process,
Marx claims, as it is the moment in which capital's particular structure
of valorization becomes possible. It is the parceling out of discrete
periods in continuous time effected by the structure of a wage that
makes valorization possible, as this structure allows some portion of
labor-time to subconsciously slip between the contract's positions. The
worker appears to be paid fairly for his time at some set rate an hour;
yet in the very motion of this apparently free and fair conscience, some
labor-time nevertheless slips away from him to the capitalist, unpaid.
Thus the unconscious advance of the worker's labor-time to the
capitalist that is effected by the structure of the wage is the gap in
which surplus value is made to appear.</p>
<p>This apparently fair but structurally imbalanced relationship between
the worker and the capitalist is the fundamental false consciousness of
capital's logic. It is what produces the gap into which capitalist
ideology can pour its misconception of equality into the consciousness
of both worker and capitalist, even as the former's condition becomes
more and more immiserating, and the latter's more and more lavish. This
structural imbalance allows capital to take its place in consciousness
and society as 'alien power' that nonetheless also feels natural and
fair. Take the following (very difficult) passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the worker himself, then, who constantly produces objective
wealth as capital, an alien power that exploits and rules over him,
while the capitalist just as constantly produces labor-power as a
subjective, abstract source of wealth that has been separated from its
own means of objectification and realization and exists only in the
worker's body– in short, the capitalist just as constantly keeps
producing the worker as a wage laborer. This constant reproduction or
perpetuation of the worker is the <em>sine qua non</em> of capitalist
production. <span class="citation"
data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx, Roberts, and Brown
2024, 525)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite appearances, it is the workers themselves who are capital's
"most essential means of production" <span class="citation"
data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx, Roberts, and Brown
2024, 527)</span>. The capitalist class cannot produce surplus value
through an apparently fair commodity production and circulation process
without their moblization of workers through the structure of a wage.
Wages are the 'invisible chains' that reinscribe class distinction in
capitalist society, replacing the conspicuous chains that patrolled that
border in pre-capitalist society:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Roman slave was fettered with chains. Invisible ties bind the
wage laborer to his owner: he merely seems to be independent. The
constant turnover among the worker's individual wage masters and the
<em>fictio juris</em> of his contract keep this semblance in place.
<span class="citation"
data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx, Roberts, and Brown
2024, 528)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wage contract is a <em>fictio juris</em>, a false premise taken
as true by capital logic to reach its desired outcome: the accumulation
of surplus value. Capital has reinterpreted the master-slave dialectic
and transsubstantiated it terms, leading to a situation in which both
master (now capitalist) and slave (now worker) have developed a
self-consciousness of freedoom, yet both remain unconsciously in bondage
to the desires of an alien power beyond their control. The capitalist is
driven to accumulate, as he occupies the position of <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em> − <em>C</em> − <em>M</em>′</span> in the
movement of value, driven to use his money to produce more than he
originally put in, the elusive moving target <span
class="math inline">′</span> that can never be satisfactorily achieved.
Even when he has accumulated more money than he knows what to do with,
more than he needs to produce a fine quality of life, he is driven
towards more money nonetheless. The worker on the other hand is driven
differently, but towards a similarly unachievable infinity in the
position of <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em> − <em>M</em> − <em>C</em>′</span>, driven
to commoditize herself as labor-power in order to acquire more and more
commodities, even at the expense of her (quality of) life.</p>
<p>Thus is humanity made a machinery in service of capital's
reproduction rather than its own, caught in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a self-perpetuating trap, continuously thrusting the one person back
into the commodity market as the seller of his labor-power while
continuously transforming his product into the other person's means of
purchasing…. [I]t also produces and reproduces the capital relation,
with the capitalist on one side and the wage laborer on the other. <span
class="citation" data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx,
Roberts, and Brown 2024, 532)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The seemingly benign concept of a commodity (unfolded in the opening
chapter <em>Capital</em>) has somehow grown into a monstrous
misapprehension of subjectivity, entangled in an external, objective
process of accumulation for its own sake. Hegel's subject [Subjekt] has
become a substance [Substanz], but not in a way where it can find its
way back again to the first term. Subjectivity is instead ensnared as a
substance that kicks off and sustains the inorganic motion of the
accumulation of value for its own sake, reducing humanity to a shadow of
itself in the unthinking conceptualization of labor as nothing more than
a replenishable repository of labor-power. Thus is labor the <em>sine
qua non</em> of capital.</p>

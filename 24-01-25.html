<p>As the new year has now turned around, I am (once again) promising
myself that I will write something more regularly. I am entering the
latter half of my third year as a PhD student at Brown University in the
department on Modern Culture and Media– a department that, unless you
happen to be invested in the landscape of a particular kind of
institutionalized humanities in the U.S., requires some context.</p>
<p>The department is generally described, and generally describes
itself, as a "media studies" program. The discipline of media studies
approaches the question of so-called 'media' from a wide berth of
lenses. Rather than working in a specifically productivist manner
towards improving existing media or imagining new forms of media, media
studies is a disciplinarily polygot designation in which scholars
research and theorize the effects of media in society.</p>
<p>Some media studies programs branch off or out from English
departments, in that they treat more modern forms of media critically in
much the same way a literary theorist or commentator might treat a text.
Though departments and scholars will stretch themselves to stress that
they work on 'many' or even 'all' forms of media, the moniker 'media
studies' is usually a not-so-veiled reference to film. Film studies
emerged in the late 20th century, as the medium was popularised and
academicized: but as the recognition that it is possible to read more
than just film as 'texts', many programs sought to rebrand from 'film
studies' to 'media studies'.</p>
<p>Though 'media' originally referred specifically to technological,
man-made media (as this was the arguably narrow-sighted focus of the
first 'media studies' scholars, i.e. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">McLuhan</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Kittler">Kittler</a>), in
recent years the berth of media's lane has become broader. At least
since John Durham Peters' 2015 book <em><a
href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo20069392.html">The
Marvelous Clouds</a></em>, it has come to be acknowledged that we can
sensibly talk about almost anything, material or immaterial, as media:
the clouds: the Earth, the Internet, animals, architecture, and so on.
This opening from media-as-technology to media-as-everything is not
dissimilar to the shift from departments of film studies to departments
of media studies: while the former designated a relatively limited field
of study, the latter presumes to sidestep those strictures and open out
into a more collaborative, more inclusive sense of itself.</p>
<p>This rebranding has opened up a pandora's box of opportunity in media
studies departments. Freed from the constraints of any particular
methodological or disciplinary backbone, 'media' is now an invertebrate
term stretched every which way. Do you write books that interpret TV
shows through a Marxist lens? That's media studies. Do you study the
political effects of radio broadcasts between U-boats in World War II?
That's media studies. Are you working on the multispecies relation
between dolphins and kelp? That's media studies.</p>
<p>Though these 'opening outs' almost certainly originate in a motion on
the part of many scholars towards a more inclusive academy, they fall
somewhat sweetly into the pockets of an administrative desire to
collateralize humanities departments under one big roof. The
"humanities" are increasingly imagined as one, big department, rather
than a collection of atomised disciplinary inquiries. In other words,
the utopian rhetoric of the 'collaborative humanities' often effects the
defunding and deterioration of humanistic pursuit under the guise of
modernizing (and even sometimes 'decolonizing') the academy.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Departments were once conceived as
shelters from the storms of executive profiteering, from the need to
find immediate 'cash value' (i.e. quantifiable according to the wayward
metrics of the neoclassical economic imagination) in certain forms of
literary, philosophical, or scientific study.</p>
<p>In 1991, a graduate of the Semiotics program at Brown made a
significant gift to that program. The Semiotics program was an
undergraduate specialization formed in the English department in 1974 in
response to student interest.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> As such, Semiotics
combined with the program of Modern Literature and Society to became the
department of Modern Culture and Media, then and now committed
specifically to "projects designed to promote and contribute to
scholarship and production dealing with theories, practices and
histories of modes of representation as they engage mass mediated
culture."<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>So Modern Culture and Media– or MCM, as it is colloquially known– is
something of a typical media studies department in that it originated in
the theory of language and literature in an English department; but now
encompasses a range of scholarly pursuits related to media of many
forms.</p>
<p>I heard about the department as an undergraduate through the work of
one its previous faculty members, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Hui_Kyong_Chun">Wendy
Chun</a>, who was a Professor in MCM until 2020. Chun works with the
training of a literary theorist (her Ph.D. from the Princeton English
department) to theorise and critique <u>digital</u> media. I studied
Computer Science in my undergrad (alongside a smattering of seminars in
German, where the media philosophy was being taught at my institution),
and had come to really enjoy coding and learning about software as an
intellectual pursuit. Because Chun was at Brown, MCM had a reputation
for literary and philosophical studies about computing in general and
software in particular. (Though Chun is no longer at Brown, many current
graduate students and faculty still work in the orbit of computing as
media in some form.)</p>
<p>I started a PhD program in MCM at Brown in September 2021, and am
currently working towards my field examinations; which I will sit in
September 2024. Next up: a primer on my fields and current course of
study.</p>

<!-- Filter buttons will be inserted here for index.html -->
<p>There has been an unintentional pause in this "daily" log of almost a
month. I caught a head-cold around mid-month, and then traveled from New
Zealand to Italy (via Berlin). The bodily strain has basically persisted
through until now - which, in partnership with a general lapse in having
the diligence to set aside time every day, has seen no logs in the
meantime.</p>
<p>I have made some parenthetical progress during this period. During
the trans-continental journey, I properly started writing a paper that
will occupy me for the better part of the next few weeks. The structure
I have planned for it will first work through the three notions of value
as subject in Marx, with reference to Rebecca Carson's book (<a
href="24-01-27.html">24-01-27</a>), Zizek's <em>Sublime Object of
Ideology</em> (<a href="24-02-05.html">24-02-05</a>, <a
href="24-02-07.html">24-02-07</a>), and Moishe Postone's 1994 book <em><a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/time-labor-and-social-domination/B2429FE0E1B401CC2F775DC2683C2025">Time,
Labor, and Social Domination</a></em>. The main proposition of this
essay will be to network these conceptions (which substantiate a
conception of the machine as a philosophical structure in Marx) with
Alan Turing's 'universal machine' - which I will attempt to wrap
together using Mladen Dolar's understanding of the automaton in his 1991
essay, "<a
href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Dolar_ShallBeWithYou.pdf">I
Shall Be with You on Your Wedding-Night</a>". I will work through more
of Zizek's book as well as Postone's, here, in the coming days towards
this.</p>
<p>More directly, I worked through two essays parenthetically related to
my lists during the journey. The first, and the subject of this log, was
Jensen Suther's "<a
href="https://online.ucpress.edu/representations/article-abstract/164/1/80/197732/Novel-Organism-FormBio-Aesthetics-in-Hegel-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Novel,
Organism, Form: Bio-Aesthetics in Hegel and Thomas Mann</a>". Suther is
a contemporary young scholar: currently (or recently) a post-doc at
Harvard, with a PhD from Yale advised by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_H%C3%A4gglund">Martin
Hagglund</a>, with an actively academic <a
href="https://twitter.com/jensensuther">Twitter presence</a>. I worked
through the essay in preparation for a seminar with Suther that a
reading group in which I participate (on Marx and alienation); a seminar
which I unfortunately missed due to a time-zone miscalculation. (It took
place in the middle of the night in Italy on my first night here.)
Despite this travel mishap, however, I found the essay very compelling
and informative in the course of my project. If I understand correctly,
the essay is a preprint (in the way some essays are) of Suther's
forthcoming book about what he calls Hegel's "bio-aesthetics".</p>
<p>In theorising Hegel as a bio-aesthetician, Suther is taking issue
with the widespread misconception that German Idealism in general and
Hegel in particular is guilty of "perpetrating an essentialist
conception of organic form - one that is ultimately thought to
underwrite a racist ecology" <span class="citation"
data-cites="sutherNovelOrganismForm2023">(Suther 2023, 81)</span>. The
stakes here are higher than just redeeming one supposedly conservative
philosopher (Hegel) from cancellation in today's task of formulating
progressive politics and philosophy: for Hegel represents the root of a
range of radical thinkers since, being the inventor of dialectical
thinking.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> To redeem Hegel is to recover
dialectics as a way to think the world politically and progressively,
against the ignominy they have suffered at the hands of post-modernism
and historicism.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>More critically for my interests, Suther reads Hegel and Marx as
productively thought together in pursuit of such a redemption. This is a
strategy that (it seems from my very cursory understanding of the space)
a new wave of Hegelian scholarship is adopting to 'politicise' Hegel
from his colloquial reputation as a <a
href="https://hegel.net/en/stewart1996.htm">Prussian apologist</a>.
Marx, both the dialectical and un-dialectical camps agree, offers us an
acceptably progressive political theory in his critique of capitalism.
And so the stakes of Hegel's progressivism can to some extent be
understood in light of the question: what <em>exactly</em> is the
relationship between Hegel's and Marx's philosophy (given that the
former undeniably had some impact on the latter)?</p>
<p>Marx's project is infamously often depicted as a simple, historicist
overturning of Hegel's idealism: Marx's materialism turned it on his
head. A user who goes by <code>old-wise-wizard</code> concisely
summarises this view in <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/g2ki67/what_is_meant_by_the_statement_that_marx_stood/">this
Reddit thread</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hegel: ideas shape circumstances.</p>
<p>Marx: economic circumstances shape our ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whereas Hegel argued that thought is the master of matter, Marx
argued that matter is the master of thought - or so goes this
reductively simple understanding. If this characterisation isn't
complicated, Hegel easily comes to appear as the archetypal White Man's
philosopher, whose idealism ultimately amounts to advocacy of a "pull
yourself up by your bootstraps" chauvinism: that is, an uncritical
supporter of capitalism who ought to then be associated with the likes
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith">Adam Smith</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo">David Ricardo</a>,
and the other "British political economists" whose viewpoint Marx's
<em>Capital</em> decisively critiqued. Of course, Hegel is not this
philosopher - not if you read his texts rather than dismissive tweets
that reference him, and not in the estimation of his supposed censurer,
Karl Marx. Just as there is an exciting wave of Hegel scholarship - like
Suther's - that investigates how misguided this head-turning view of
Hegel-qua-Marx is by reading Hegel through Marx, there is a
complementary effort in Marx scholarship that reads Marx through Hegel.
The revival of Hegel's relevance in Marx scholarship is closely allied
with a set of contemporary Marxian schools of thought (which interest
me), such as the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neue_Marx-Lekt%C3%BCre">New Reading
of Marx</a> (associated principally to Michael Heinrich, a "<a
href="https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2023/12/23/marxs-value-theory-and-the-value-form-interpretation/">David
Harvey of Europe</a>") and value-theoretical readings such as Moishe
Postone's and Rebecca Carson's.</p>
<p>Thus is the substance of my interest in Suther's work, despite not
myself being particularly fluent in Hegel's philosophy, nor modernist
(or any other kind of) literary criticism. It is also one way of
understanding what is at stake in a Hegelian bio-aesthetics "grounded in
the logical form of the organism" <span class="citation"
data-cites="sutherNovelOrganismForm2023">(Suther 2023, 81)</span>. To
position Hegel's aesthetics as reliant on a thorough theory of life and
nature (the organism) is to render it capable of reckoning with matter
more 'material', rather than relegating it to the annals of theories
that are too esoteric and idealistic to have any political bearing on
the world at hand.</p>
<p>As certain thinkers of Hegel - namely the Ljubljana school and its
psychoanalytic associates - have argued for some time now, such a case
for Hegel's 'materialism' is both a political redemption of (German)
Idealism, as well as the grounds for critique of the mushrooming growth
of cruder and cruder materialisms. These multifarious materialisms want
to un-think thought as a quality distinct from matter, banishing it from
its selfish and self-aggrandising speculation in the figure of the
"human", and stuffing it instead inside rocks, flowers, and poisons.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> To insist that Hegel's philosophy -
and indeed, his idealism - matters is recognise that we cannot simply
think ourselves out of the picture in our experience of the world. As
Lacan puts it (in his characteristically opaque and 'punny' way): "the
picture is in my eye, but <em>I</em> am also in the picture" (see <a
href="https://nosubject.com/Parallax">here</a>). In other words, we
cannot simply think the subject (of the sentence, of consciousness) out
of existence. We must instead thematise it as carefully as possible,
recognising where it is essentially impotent in the face of a state of
affairs, and where it maybe just may have an actual freedom to choose,
rather than to be externally determined.</p>
<p>Suther's essay articulates a theory of Hegelian bio-aesthetics with
an intention "to grasp the stakes of [Thomas] Mann's… modernist revival
of the <em>Bildungsroman</em>" in his monumental novel <em><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Mountain">The Magic
Mountain</a></em>, a work begun in 1912 and completed in 1924 <span
class="citation" data-cites="sutherNovelOrganismForm2023">(Suther 2023,
81)</span>. The <em><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman">Bildungsroman</a></em>
is a literary genre deeply associated with German Idealism, as works of
<em>Bildungsroman</em> were directly considered by philosophers in that
movement, and also because the genre is a touchstone in the (European)
literary landscape of the long 19th century. Though I am not personally
particularly well equipped to reckon with what waves Suther is
attempting to make in literary theory with this position, the essay does
strike me as an impressive and ambitious intervention in the
understanding of <em>Bildungsroman</em>. Mann's novel lacks, of course,
no depth of criticism; nor does the <em>Bildungsroman</em> genre; nor
does Hegel. Thus if Suther's critique does hold together, it is a
careful and scholarly work of thought.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>While I cannot afford to get into greater detail about Suther's
account now, here is the essay's abstract so that I might make some
concluding remarks about where I might take gentle issue with one
dimension of the argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This essay intervenes in the contemporary debate surrounding the
<em>Bildungsroman</em> and its roots in German Idealism through a new
reading of the idea of "life" in two major modern texts: G. W. F.
Hegel's Lectures on Fine Art and the famous "Research" chapter of Thomas
Mann's <em>The Magic Mountain</em>. I establish three key points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hegel pioneers a bio-aesthetics that grasps the work of art as a
distinctly social and historical, reflective manifestation of organic
life;</li>
<li>Mann's novel achieves a kind of self-conscious knowledge of the
<em>Bildungsroman</em> in particular as such a manifestation; and</li>
<li>Karl Marx's analysis of the alienation of humanity from its
"species-being" under capitalism accounts for the opposition between

<p>While I agree that capitalism exercises a "deformative" effect on the
human relation to what (young) Marx calls its "species-being", towards
the end of the essay Suther seems to suggest in the essay that a return
to Hegel's bio-aesthetics (a thinking 'before' Marx) offers us a way to
think life as flourishing in contradistinction to capitalism's capture
and obstruction of it. He does this in a final section titled "Beyond
the <em>Bildung</em> principle" <span class="citation"
data-cites="sutherNovelOrganismForm2023">(Suther 2023, 96)</span>, a
play on <em>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</em> (1920, notably), the text
in which Freud most famously theorised the death drive. In marking
Mann's novel as a representation of "the novel of deformation", i.e. as
an alienation under capitalism of a supposed pre-capitalist flourishing,
Suther seems to take Freud's death drive as a symptom of our
(unavoidable) alienation under capitalism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Freud, in reference to Schopenhauer, formulates the idea of the
"death drive" (<em>Todestrieb</em>) as the innate tendency of life
toward an original state of quiescence…. [The possibility of a formative
drive] is diverted by a process of <em>deformation</em>, codified in the
idea of a <em>Todestrieb</em>. <span class="citation"
data-cites="sutherNovelOrganismForm2023">(Suther 2023, 102)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking Freud's theory of the death drive as his recognition of our
deformative will-to-power under the condition of capitalist alienation,
Suther then suggests that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hegel provides a radically different, Aristotelian account of the
structure of satisfaction and desire…. Desire, then, is not a stain to
be eliminated but the organism's valenced way of responding to the
elements of its environment as either means or obstacles to its possible
<em>flourishing</em>. <strong>Hegel thus gives us a powerful alternative
to Schopenhauer and Freud and to Mann's narrator</strong> <span
class="citation" data-cites="sutherNovelOrganismForm2023">(Suther 2023,
102–3)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to me a misreading of Freud's death drive as a strictly
deformative condition of being (under capitalism), rather than as a
recognition of the <em>necessary contradiction that undergirds the
possibility of freedom in modernity</em>.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The
alienation of our species-being is the condition of our domination under
capitalism, yes: but it is paradoxically also the prerequisite of our
distinctly modern freedom, i.e. a state of being in relation to
ourselves in which we can avoid the totalizing effect of that very same
domination. Psychoanalysis is the name of the philosophical project to
<em>work through</em> this necessary state of alienation (or
deformation, in Suther's schema) towards an elusive ideal of freedom, of
'free association' and un-capitalised desire.</p>
<p>The necessity of working through alienation rather than returning to
a state before it (or accelerating or otherwise imploding it to get to a
post-capitalist state after it) is a point on which Freud and Marx
agree, despite the misapprehensions of their projects otherwise. Far
from being a further entrapment in alienation by way of a defeatist
pessimism, psychoanalysis is paradoxically a project to achieve
<em>disalienation</em> without succumbing to the persuasive persistence
of desire's and actions wily capture by capital's abstract domination.
To laud Hegel as an alternative to the "pessimism" that Suther wants to
associate with Freud, then, risks the same misunderstanding of Marx that
Moishe Postone critiqued as "traditional Marxism" in his 1994 book,
<em>Time, Labor, and Social Domination</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="postoneTimeLaborSocial1996">(Postone 1996)</span>.<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Marx's project in <em>Capital</em>
is not the critique of capitalism from the standpoint of labor (a
position that hypostasises labor as a concept that is
<em>transhistorical</em>); but rather the critique of labor in
capitalism (which sees the particular figuration of labor in the
movement of value - and, it is worth noting, in relation to the
reproduction of human life - as a form that is historically specific to
capitalism) <span class="citation"
data-cites="postoneTimeLaborSocial1996">(Postone 1996, chap. 1)</span>.
Thus, given that our situation of thought is necessarily conditioned by
capital as a precondition, we cannot easily think a purely formative
flourishing (a <em>Bildungsroman</em>) that is devoid from its
deformative negative. We cannot return to a straightforward socialist
optimism, even if it is carefully and thoughtfully Hegelian in its
composition, to solve capitalism's intrinsic pessimism.</p>
<p>Though Suther's position on this is mostly secondary to his argument
in this essay (most of which, as noted above, I find strikingly
incisive), he re-articulates his skepticism of the psychoanalytic
project in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PvszsHWbYU">an
interview about his work</a> from about a year ago. Lacanianism, Suther
argues, by which he means the strand of leftist psychoanalytic
philosophy associated with Zizek (and the Ljubljana school by
extension), inevitably ends up with a kind of "unhappy consciousness," a
term that Suther draws from a progression in Hegel's <em>Phenomenology
of Spirit</em>. This is a symptom, Suther continues, of Lacan's reading
of Hegel being mostly by way of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Koj%C3%A8ve">Alexandre
Kojève</a>: and just as the two Hegelian Roberts (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_B._Pippin">Robert Pippin</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brandom">Robert
Brandom</a>) depart from Kojève, so too does Suther.</p>
<p>As I have stated above, I think I would tend to disagree on this
point. The psychoanalytic project is only stuck with an unhappy
consciousness to the extent that it acknowledges the existence of a
structural alienation in capitalism that we can only think
<em>through</em>, and not before or after. I don't have the Hegelian or
Lacanian chops (at present) to take this issue back through Lacan,
Kojève, Brandom, and Pippin. Though I think that Suther's misreading of
the Freudian death drive in the essay treated here is an indicative
start; and perhaps this is a project that I will pursue at some point in
the future.</p>

address <em>new</em> work: new novels, new films, new artists. While I
agree with many shades of the suggestion that we as scholars ought to
broaden the horizon of work that we read theoretically, I disagree with
a militantly progressivist emphasis that prevents us from returning to
the 'classics' for fear that they have either been discussed and
theorised 'enough' (as if theory were an exercise one could finish or
conclude) or, worse, that the study of classics is in itself a kind of
conservative, politically regressive undertaking. Indeed, it seems to me
that it might be more politically efficacious for academics to
re-theorise (even radicalise) the classics, rather than effectively
'cancelling' the study of them altogether. It is also worth noting, I
think, that it can require a different kind of care and capacity to say
something worthwhile ('new') about a work that has already been so
deeply discussed, sometimes across centuries.<a href="#fnref4"

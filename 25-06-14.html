<p>I started reading Alma Steingart's 2023 <a
href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo186192600.html">Axiomatics:
Mathematical THought and High Modernism</a> in preparation for a reading
group on Math(s), Philosophy, and History that I have been running for
almost a year now. (We meet approximately bi-weekly, and wander from
text to text based on the group's discussion and shared interest.)
Steingart's narrative is deeply relevant to the <a
href="./24-01-26.html">third stream</a> of my disseration, the question
of mathematics in the 20th century, as it argues that there is an
intellectual history of (the rise of) axiomatics in mathematics in the
20th century that corresponds to modernist cultures of art, linguistics,
sociology, and other disciplines that became infatuated with
mathematical rigor in the ascent of "the postwar abstractionist theory
of knowledge" <span class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
23)</span>. Concretely, Steingart promises (in the introduction) to
provide an account of how topology and category theory can be understood
as mathematical cultures that represent what she calls "high modernist
mathematics" <span class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
20)</span>, how the utility of mathematics in various disciplines took
on a more 'abstract' character after the war in projects such as game
theory, and how the abstract character of axiomatic mathematics bears a
relation to the "aesthetic autonomy" <span class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
22)</span> of artistic formalism and stucturalist anthropology, among
other disciplines that were coming to be characterized by a flirtation
with mathematization, during the Cold War era.</p>
<p>The book's introduction frames this effort in intellectual history
through a smattering of terms that constellate the 'bigger picture'
which theoretically coheres each individual chapter's analysis of more
specific historical actors and moments. It took me a second reading to
begin to feel like they were adequately disambiguated, but I now feel
that they give a helpful coherence to Steingart's project. The important
terms clarified in the book's introduction, which I will develop in
pairs in this b/log, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstraction</li>
<li>Modernism</li>
<li>High Modernism</li>
<li>Axiomatics</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Mathematization</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="abstraction-and-modernism">Abstraction and Modernism</h1>
<p>Abstraction is the principal term that grounds Steingart's inquiry,
and thus in the introduction she accordingly gives us two, mutually
informing accounts of it: "one following abstraction's history as a mode
of thought and the other as a marker of modernism" <span
class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
6)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="./img/history-of-abstraction.png" width="570" /></p>
<p>The history of abstraction as a mode of thought (pp.6-10) is
summarised above. Historically speaking (for Steingart), abstraction
originates in a quandary regarding language's apprehension of the
physical world. How do apparently universalizing words such as 'color'
emerge from the world's particularity? Thought, it seems, must have to
take something away from the world, to <em>abstract</em> something from
it, in order to produce such concepts.</p>
<p>The pivotal figure in this sketch of a condensed history is George
Berkeley. Berkeley is "a staunch idealist" <span class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
7)</span>; yet he is <em>also</em> the first in Steingart's condensed
history to strongly rebuke abstraction. For Berkeley, "reality consists
exclusively of minds and their ideas" <span class="citation"
data-cites="downingGeorgeBerkeley2021">(Downing 2021)</span>; yet
Steingart pens Berkeley as notable in the history of abstraction
precisely because he refuses to allow a conceptual space of ideas that
is not firmly rooted in the phenomenological world of ideas <span
class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
7)</span>.</p>
<p>With Berkeley, the nature of the difference between idealism and
materialism is revealed clearly as a contradiction, Steingart seems to
suggest. She glosses over the philosophical specificity of Berkeley's
claim by lumping him in with the empiricists Locke and Hume: "What
Locke, Berkeley, and Hume made clear is that the problem of abstraction
as an operative mode of thought touches directly on the foundations of
geometry, the signification function of language, and the relation
between perception and reason" <span class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
8)</span>. Fair enough here, perhaps, as Steingart has flagged up front
that her concern is not with the nuances of philosophical positions on
the matter of abstraction, so much as it is with painting a historical
canvas which provides context for what she means when she says
'abstraction' in the rest of the book. The lineage presented
<em>does</em> make clear what is at stake in abstraction
(notwithstanding its suspicously British contrivance): namely, the
sticky and difficult relationship between mind and matter, subject and
object, idealism and materialism. Though this is a strange progression
from Aristotle to Marx in some respects, it sets the stage for the way
in which abstract mathematics dances around the politicality of its own
position, an argument that Steingart will make with respect to concrete
actors in the 20th century.</p>
<p>The 'other side' of abstraction's definition, Steingart has told us,
is its apparent entanglement with <strong>modernism</strong> (p.10).
There doesn't seem to be any notable distinction between modernity and
modernism for Steingart, and this slippage allows Steingart to settle on
Fredic Jameson's account in his 2013 book <a
href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/1818-a-singular-modernity"><em>A
Singular Modernity</em></a> as the backstop for the claim that modernism
and abstraction are two sides of the same coin. I haven't yet read this
book of Jameson's, and so I can't be sure of the following points. But I
would hazard a guess that <em>modernity</em> for Jameson is structurally
coupled with the problematic of the mangling of subject and object that
Marx argues is a symptom ('fetish') of capital's installment as a social
relation, and thus bemoans a philosophical history reaching back at
least to Descartes if not further; whereas <em>modernism</em> refers
instead to an aesthetic category that is historically specific to the
20th century (whence Jameson's infamous critique of postmodernism).
Modernism is not unrelated to modernity, which is why Steingart's
account that "the association of abstraction and modernism is
<em>not</em> a continuation of the long philosophical and political
tradition I just outlined, but instead represents a clean break from it"
<span class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
10)</span> strikes me as a bit suspicious.</p>
<p>Steingart wants to segment (or perhaps we should say 'abstract')
20th-century abstraction from its pre-20th-century forebears by
recognizing the newer phenomenon as a "severing of abstraction from the
phenomenological world" , a turn away from the "etymological root" of
abstraction in its reference to something <em>of</em> the world <span
class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
11)</span>. But isn't something of this operation already at work in the
various idealisms that contest the empiricism of Hume, Locke, and
Boethius in the 18th and 19th centuries? We could offer the names
Descartes, Kant, and Hegel, for example, as a counter-history of
Steingart's abstraction, a lineage which also culminates in an important
sense in the first master of suspicion, Marx. All three of these
thinkers were (it doesn't seem controversial to claim) concerned with
the status of thought on its own terms, thought 'for itself' that was
ideally purified of phenomenological reference. This German lineage as a
counterpoint to the British one Steingart gives at the least proves that
the "crisis of referentiality" <span class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
12)</span> of the 20th century is not the <em>first</em> such crisis
that abstraction suffered in philosophy. The curious triad of
"linguistics and scientific philosophy" <span class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
12)</span> that is then given to evidence abstraction's reversal of
meaning in the 20th century– Ferdinand de Saussure, Albert Einstein, and
Alfred North Whitehead– are brought into the historical-philosophical
fray almost as if there is no precedent for the problem of the object,
the subject, and the sphere of signification that necessarily traverses
the two in language. It might be that 'modernism' names a distinct
inflection of the constitutive problematic of modernity in the 20th
century, but it is not clear to me that this inflection's distinction
rests neatly on its reversal of abstraction's etymological root in the
phenomenological world.</p>
<h1 id="high-modernism-and-axiomatics">High Modernism and
Axiomatics</h1>
<p>High modernism for Steingart is above all associated with David
Hilbert and the crisis in foundations of mathematics. In other words,
high modernism emerges as a dialect of modernism through the
proliferation of the axiomatic method (associated with Hilbert) in
mathematics and other disciplines. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki">Bourbaki group</a>
is given as "the most extreme example of mathematical high modernism"
<span class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
17)</span>, as they emblematise a particular configuration of the
relationship between mathematical theory and empirical reality. High
modernist mathematics sees theory as a practice/process that is
constituted as an autonomous aesthetic domain, free from the demanding
contrivances of the (material) world. The high modernist attitude is
fundamentally idealist in the sense that the domain of thought and
theory is not borne of patterns or perceptions in the phenomenological
world, but autonomously, on its own terms. Mathematical theory for the
high modernist is conceived <em>beyond</em> or <em>besides</em> the
world, but is then tested by its applications <em>in</em> the world.
This phenomenology of theory in mathematical high modernism is what
gives the history of axiomatics' proliferation its seemingly
contradictory characters, "denoting the rationalization of social life
on the one hand and the promotion of an autonomous aesthetic sphere on
the other" <span class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
18)</span>. For Steingart, game theory, communications theory,
operations research, and computing (by which I assume she means the
burgeoning discipline of Computer Science) all suffer this kind of
speculative pragmatics that is both idealistic and utilitarian <span
class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
19)</span>, and can all thus be united in axiomatics as their common
rationale and prehistory.</p>
<p>Grouping these histories under the rubric of high modernism is
evocative also, as Steingart notes, due to James Scott's use of the term
as "a particularly sweeping vision of how the benefits of technical and
scientific progress might be applied" <span class="citation"
data-cites="steingartAxiomaticsMathematicalThought2023">(Steingart 2023,
17)</span>. High modernism names a technocratic worldview that parades
as thoroughly materialist, but which in fact is built on an unconscious
idealist kernel that hazards scientific theory as autonomous (and thus
unimpeachable) rather than grounded in the world and our flawed
phenomenology of it. Perhaps it is this quality, i.e. the repression of
an idealist basis for the claim of scientific validity, that better
characterizes high modernism's break from the modernisms (and
modernities) before it. Berkeley, Hume, and Burke would then be
correctly identified as the prime philosophical actors in mathematical
high modernism's prehistory, but for reasons to do with the way that
they each repress in their own way <em>the necessary politics of
abstraction</em>, enshrining some part of it as independent of the world
and thus paving the way for its unimpeachability. (Kant would surely
also feature prominently in this historical drama.)</p>
<p>Though the distinction between abstraction, modernism, and high
modernism took me a second reading to make out clearly in Steingart's
introduction, axiomatics appeared early as a clear intellectual
historical object (if such a thing can be thought to exist). Axiomatics
are the methods in mathematics based on the spectral objectivity of
<em>numbers</em> posited at the turn of the twentieth century, newly
realized through the questioning of their basis in physical reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are numbers? Within the new regime of objectivity, neither the
empiricist nor the idealist answer was acceptable. Numbers were not
arrived at by counting, nor were they synthetic a priori. <span

<p>Cantor goes curiously unmentioned, but we get the other usual
suspects in Dedekind, Peano, Frege, and Hilbert. Steingart's argument is
that the proliferation of axiomatics within mathematics and their
percolation throughout other disciplines in the humanities and the
sciences should be considered a high modernism in the history of
abstraction.</p>
<h1 id="mathematics-and-mathematization">Mathematics and
Mathematization</h1>
<p>The final two terms I wanted to disambiguate are these. While
mathematics seems to usually refer to the actual disciplinary practice
of professional mathematicians (and thus 'mathematical high modernism'
is an appropriate description of axiomatics' preponderance at
universities in postwar America), <em>mathematization</em> seems to
refer instead to the dissemination of paradigms in mathematics to other
disciplines, such as sociology, anthropology, and linguistics, as well
as how mathematical technique was consciously applied in these other
disciplines. To the extent that Steingart's book is a story about
mathematization, then, it is in the company of recent books such as
Bernard Dionysus Geoghegan's <a
href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/code"><em>Code: From Information Theory
to French Theory</em></a> in that it accounts for how mathematics became
the Hermes of a disciplinary pantheon conceptually divided into the
humanities and the sciences. (Along with Computer Science, mathematics
is– I think– one of the few undergraduate degrees in America that is
offered both as a Bachelor of Arts and as a Bachelor of Science,
depending on the granting institution.)</p>
<p>Many now are taking issue with mathematization as a sort of root
cause of much that is disagreeable politically about the contemporary
world. It seems important to me that we give nuance to the claim, made
by many these days, that it is mathematization (or Computer Science) as
such that is the problem, if only because throwing out maths and
computing tout court is not an option on the table. I intend to proceed
with reading the rest of this book because it offers some such nuance in
locating axiomatics as a specific culture in mathematics and tracing its
social and (perhaps) political effects.</p>

<!-- Filter buttons will be inserted here for index.html -->
<p>The pause in proceedings here has been principally due to a (final)
semester of coursework and teaching at Brown University; the other side
of a PhD in the U.S. I have now advanced to candidacy, which means that
I have completed all requirements for my PhD except the submission of
the dissertation itself. (This is also known as being <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_but_dissertation">ABD</a>, ``all
but dissertation".)</p>
<p>I was in Providence for this stint (September through December 2024),
and though the period has certainly been generative in terms of meeting
milestones and generating sparks for further research, I didn't manage
to make any time to write here throughout. So I return with a brief
recap of the contours of my past few months.</p>
<h1 id="teaching-cceai">Teaching CCeAI</h1>
<p>One of the features of the <a href="./24-01-25.html">PhD program in
Modern Culture and Media at Brown</a> is that students are expected to
teach an undergraduate seminar of their own design around their fourth
year. It is recommended that this seminar trace a student's intellectual
fields, as it is ideally taught just after completing the <a
href="./24-01-26.html">fields examination</a>. (In my case, I sat the
fields exam halfway through the same semester in which I was teaching my
own course, due mainly to logistical issues with convening my
advisors.)</p>
<p>I titled my course '<a href="https://cceai.ohrg.org/">Capitalism and
Computers in the Era of AI</a>', acronymically 'CCeAI'. As expected,
about half of my students were majors in Computer Science, interested to
relieve their technical coursework with some critical reflection on the
economy and politics of computing more generally. The <a
href="https://cceai.ohrg.org/syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a> lays out the
course's focus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the relation between capital and the computer? To answer this
question, this course attends to the particulars of the computer as a
mathematical proposition, to its claim to legitimacy as a logic of
superior military and political organization, and to its elaboration as
something of a natural philosophy in scientific practice. In doing so,
we will formulate a conceptual basis to critically assess the glittery
promises of current discourse invoking Artificial Intelligence (A.I),
which sees near-total automation as inevitable and the threat of
sentient Artificial General Intelligence (A.G.I) as nigh. We will
establish a critique of the computer as a structure (i.e. as a
philosophical arrangement with a specific and persistent imagination) to
think critically about popular ideologies associated with A.I., often
put forward by those with capital stake in its commercial success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All in all, I was pleased with the way that the course turned out.
Due to unexpected interruptions in the academic calendar coupled with a
sense that we needed to spend more time with the material in the early
weeks to properly get a grasp on it, we skipped the week titled
'Ideology' (Zizek), as well as the final week titled 'Psychoanalysis?'.
I am still myself working out the appropriate way to cross-pollinate
Marxian theory and Lacanian psychoanalysis, I realised as we approached
each of these weeks, and so it felt an unreasonably far throw in the
course's overall argument to sidestep into Zizek's theory of ideology
(which I wrote some about <a href="./24-02-05.html">here</a> and <a
href="./24-02-07.html">here</a>) directly after a tough week attempting
to chart Marx's theory of commodity fetishism via Michael Heinrich's
(excellent but dense) introduction to it; and while I would estimate the
final week's reading as at a slightly more appropriate level for the
course, there was a holiday that I had not accounted for throughout the
semester (election day).</p>
<p>The texts in this syllabus represent a trajectory of my own thinking
regarding the intimate philosophical relation between capital and the
computer. The course locates the <strong>computer</strong> through three
supposed inventors of it in the first three weeks: Charles Babbage
(1830-70s), Alan Turing (1930-50s), and Norbert Wiener (1920s-60s). Each
of these three men is esteemed as a populariser of the computer's
concept, and we can glean important characteristics of the imaginaries
that proliferate from their writing and writing about them.</p>
<p>The course's core argument is that there <em>is</em> a fundamental
relationship between the computer and capital, and so in the weeks
following an elaboration of the computer, we looked to firm up a sense
of capital's contours and characteristics, particularly the aspects of
its theory that have been explicitly employed in critical discussion
about cybernetics and the computer. Each of the weeks whose titles end
with a question mark are designed to provide texts through which
students can observe and practise critical thinking with respect to the
computer, capital, and cybernetics, consisting of contemporary attempts
to theorise a relationship between these terms, rather than of
introductions to a concept as the earlier weeks' texts do. The course
culminates in a ten page paper on a topic of students' chooosing.</p>
<p>Through teaching the course I have certainly learned that there is a
real difference between the way that one reads as an undergraduate, and
how one reads as a graduate student. I think I knew this already, but in
some sense I have resisted the idea, as I sought to flout the
hierarchical distinction as an undergrad, and of course don't believe in
any fundamental demarcation. (There are certainly particular undergrads
who are smarter / better readers than certain grad students.) But in
general, undergrads in US institutions are beset with circumstances that
make it difficult to imagine that there is value in reading texts
closely, repetitiously. This is not something to hold against
undergrads, I don't think, but rather against the regimes of value that
flood in and out of (neo)liberal arts institutions. Five courses a
semester is both far too much and far too little. One doesn't have to
work particularly hard to keep head above water, especially at Brown
where <a
href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/undergraduate/open-curriculum">grades
don't hold much weight</a>; but there is also too much noise in the days
and weeks if one were to want to seriously study something particular in
the oceany midst of weekly obligations.</p>
<h1 id="the-internet-and-datacenter-operating-systems"><a
href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci2680/fall2024/">The Internet</a>
and <a
href="https://brown-csci2690.github.io/classwebsite-fall24/">Datacenter
Operating Systems</a></h1>
<p>I decided to take two graduate seminars in computer science to wrap
up my masters degree in the department, and I learned a lot about
research in the discipline through the experience. The experience of
reading four papers a week from operating systems and Internet research
was instructive in the sense that I realised how different the work of
keeping up with computer science is from keeping up with continental
theory. The journals are different, of course. But so is the kind of
effort that reading each paper involves, and the time one must set aside
in the day to engage with it. I like the difference in the experience
between the two disciplines in which I have decided to make an effort to
become literate; though it is certainly true that I feel more equipped
at this stage to parse papers in continental theory than I do those in
computer science.</p>
<p>The work involved in each (systems) paper in computer science is also
enormous. It takes at least a year to prototype a system, to run
experiments, etc, and it is often a multi-person effort. The scale of
the research is still relatively small and individualistic compared to
other scientific disciplines, but it is a notably different (and more
social) experience of research than reading and writing philosophical
papers.</p>
<p>The main thread that emerged from these two courses for me was a
burgeoning familiarity with vector databases, which I had decided to try
to get a handle on early in the semester so as to be able to code
something substantially systems-oriented for my final projects in the
courses. The system I have now started working on is currently called <a
href="https://github.com/breezykermo/oak">OAK</a>, and while I am not
yet sure that it offers something distinctively innovative or original
in vector databases research, it is at least a very good way for me to
practically get a handle on the current state of vector indexes, and to
think about what kinds of opportunities there might be for turning
research into practice in this domain (i.e. coding up research papers as
new components of OAK).</p>
<h1 id="german-idealism-and-canguilhem">German Idealism and
Canguilhem</h1>
<p>The other two courses that I either took or audited this semester
were respectively about Kant with political theorist <a
href="https://www.alexgourevitch.org/">Alex Gourevitch</a>, and about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Canguilhem">Georges
Canguilhem</a> with my advisor and chair, Joan Copjec. The first of
these will likely see some thematically related posts in the coming
weeks, as I am now starting work on a paper about Kant and Marx to
submit as the final paper for that course, so I won't discuss it at
length here. The second course with Joan, which I audited, was
revelatory even though I was not able to complete much of the reading
for it in advance. The basic premise was that Canguilhem's ideas bear
some relation to Lacan's, and so we sat each week listening to Joan
hypothesize connections between the two thinkers.</p>
<p>While it perhaps doesn't come directly on the back of this seminar,
and is rather an idea that I have been stewing for some time, I intend
to read Joan's work more closely in the new year, and to record the way
in which I understand it via video, rather than here in writing. I am
not exactly sure how this will work at this stage, so I will not
speculate further. But I have resolutely decided that I ought to get
deeply familiar with her body of work, for though it is far-reaching, it
is relatively short in terms of actual page counts. (A credit to the
incredible effort that Joan puts into each paper, not dissimilar to the
year-long efforts of systems papers I note above.)</p>

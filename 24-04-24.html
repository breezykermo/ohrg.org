<!-- Filter buttons will be inserted here for index.html -->
<p>I have been at the institute (the <a
href="https://www.iwm.at/">IWM</a>) for nearly a month now, the first
month of three. It is the first time that I have had something close to
my own office (I share a room with one other fellow), and the first time
that I have had the space and time of mind to attend specifically to the
task of my dissertation proper. As a PhD student in Providence, there is
a bustle of daily university life - lectures, seminars, meetings - that
makes it more difficult to properly think. Perhaps this is because it is
the aim of a PhD to find a unique space of thought, and such a pocket
(carved out against the majority of opinion, if it is to have any
academic value) is necessarily solitary. The PhD project is to design
such a space, to educate oneself in how it reflects and refracts
existing projects (of existing academics), and to come to some confident
enough conclusion in it that one appears salable on the job market.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks I have tracked four contemporary projects that
relate to the space I am trying to carve for myself at the <a
href="24-01-26.html">intersection of mathematics, Marx, and Lacan</a>.
I'll introduce two of them here (Amanda Holmes' and Adrian Johnston's),
and defer two of them (Svitlana Matviyenko's and Sarah Pourcieau's) to a
later log.</p>
<h1 id="amanda-holmes"><a
href="https://www.dieangewandte.at/jart/prj3/angewandte-2016/main.jart?rel=en&amp;reserve-mode=active&amp;content-id=1458930944469&amp;Pe-Id=8332">Amanda
Holmes</a></h1>
<p>Completing her PhD in <a
href="https://www1.villanova.edu/university/liberal-arts-sciences/programs/philosophy.html">philosophy
at Villanova</a> in 2020, Holmes was advised by <a
href="https://philpeople.org/profiles/walter-brogan">Walter Brogan</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Rockhill">Gabriel
Rockhill</a>, and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alenka_Zupan%C4%8Di%C4%8D">Alenka
Zupančič</a>. Her dissertation was titled <em>Erotology: The Logos of
Eros in Lacan's Return to Freud</em>, and its structure is refreshingly
un-American in its singular focus on tracking what Holmes calls
'erotology' in Lacan's thought. Erotology is "the logos of eros, the
study of desire, the disciplined examination of those gaps in the
universe around which desire gathers…. the discipline of identifying and
elaborating the philosophical implications of psychoanalysis" <span
class="citation" data-cites="holmesErotologyLogosEros2020">(Holmes 2020,
7)</span>. Erotology is the fourth term that psychoanalysis, as an
inflection point in and critique of the Western (European) philosophical
tradition, introduces to the reigning triumvirate of ontology (the
science of being), epistemology (the science of thinking), and
phenomenology (the science of feeling). Lacan's return to Freud, a
project that takes psychoanalysis seriously as a philosophical invention
and intervention, is erotological because it is "a discourse that takes
desire as its central focus" <span class="citation"
data-cites="holmesErotologyLogosEros2020">(Holmes 2020, 8)</span>.</p>
<p>Holmes' dissertation does what good dissertations should do, I think:
it synthesizes the state of a discursive space, offering the seeds of a
'new' argument only by first demonstrating erudition and pedagogical
generosity as a writer. There is an overwhelming sense (in America) that
one's dissertation is supposed to operate as a 'scientific'
breakthrough, exposing some connection heretofore unseen and
unconceptualized. This contributes to the reigning paradigm of paranoiac
collaboration and publication, whereby there is an idea that one's
academic space or niche can be stolen, as if intellectual specialization
were a patented technology that needs regulatory mechanisms to protect
its strategic advantage. This framing is not to downplay the very real
and common occurrence of more senior scholars taking advantage of
younger ones as a fungible labor force, manipulating the cult of
authorial singularity in the humanities through their positions of
relative power so as to significantly disadvantage and dispossess more
junior persons of their due credit and/or acclaim. But it is to suggest
that we should consider the limitations of the conceptual treatment of
academic ideas as intellectual property, i.e. as salable commodities
that should circulate in such a way that the benefit gained thereof
warrants a financial or reputational 'interest' that accrues to their
authors. Some will say that the commodified condition of the market of
ideas is just the way it is, the realpolitik of (American) academia
within which one must operate to have any relevance, and/or to feed
oneself and one's "family". Perhaps this is the case. But shouldn't we
still do our best to imagine it otherwise, and implement this
imagination as much as we can, as much as we are allowed to?</p>
<p>It is rich, perhaps the same some will say, to suggest that the
dedicated study of an infamously cryptic and white French man's seminars
from the 60s and 70s represents a progressive (i.e. less commodified)
kind of scholarship. And it is probably true that Lacanians have failed
to convincingly articulate why such a thing could really (as I am coming
to believe it to be) the case. But I really do digress, here, as the
point that I set out to make is that Holmes' dissertation on Lacan is a
valuable addition to the available other introductions to the Lacanian
ethos of desire (i.e. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sublime_Object_of_Ideology">Zizek</a>'s,
<a
href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Gallop_Reading_Lacan.pdf">Gallop</a>'s,
to name a few that I have discussed on this site), and perhaps one that
is the most up-to-date regarding more recent Lacan scholarship, such as
Zupančič's <em><a
href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262534130/what-is-sex/">What Is
Sex?</a></em>.</p>
<h1 id="adrian-johnston"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Johnston_(philosopher)">Adrian
Johnston</a></h1>
<p>I intend to discuss Johnston's most recent book <em><a
href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/infinite-greed/9780231214735">Infinite
Greed</a></em> at more length in future logs on this site, as it is one
of the most erudite studies of the relationship between Lacan's and
Marx's thought available. In recent weeks I have read a <a
href="https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/items/35ce4f03-fba6-465d-8862-b44a2d9bc5d7">2017
essay</a> that prefigures the argument in that book, and I am now
working through a manuscript of the book itself.</p>
<p>The core argument (of both the essay and the book, as I understand
them) is that Marx's critique of political economy in <em>Capital</em>
prefigures some of the core psychoanalytic insights, the discourse of
which Johnston suggestively refers to as <strong>libidinal
economy</strong>. There are "temporal dialectical dynamics between past
and present (as well as future)" <span class="citation"
data-cites="johnstonClosedNeedInfinite2017">(Johnston 2017, 277)</span>
that Marx's and the psychoanalytic accounts share, and in articulating
this common understanding one can marry metapsychology (psychoanalysis)
and historical materialism (Marx). The terminological lodestone of this
effort is <em>Trieb</em> [drive], a word used by Freud, Lacan, and Marx
alike.</p>
<p>Drive in the Lacano-Freudian sense of the term can be understood
through Freud's enigmatic and polarizing suggestion that the human is
characterized by her/his <strong>death drive</strong>. The final chapter
of Alenka Zupančič's book <em>What Is Sex?</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="zupancicWhatSex2017">(Zupančič 2017)</span> is a sublime
rumination on and interpretation of the death drive as it should be
understood: as the name for the object-less affect that emerges from the
unknowable contradiction in consciousness called 'sex'. At once aimed at
reproduction, as a crude Darwinian imaginary would have it, and
paradoxically also at a self-annihilating end in 'death', the death
drive is what differentiates a speaking being from an animal in Lacanian
thought. Speaking being is characterized by a contradiction in its telos
(purpose), whereby there is an element of indetermination in its (life)
trajectory that gives rise to a special kind of under-determined drive
called <strong>desire</strong>. Desire has no overdetermined object: it
is a subject that strives not for something in particular, but for
something 'abstract'. Thus Lacan refers to the object of desire as the
<strong>objet petit a</strong>; for it is not an object in particular,
but an absent and negative object that must be 'filled in' in order for
the striving to make sense in a causal register. We do not desire
because desire can be achieved, fully satisfied and sated. We rather
continue to desire exactly because the object of desire (<em>objet petit
a</em>) cannot ever properly concretize as something positive (a person,
an amount of money); and so once we achieve what we thought we wanted,
what it is we want has moved on.</p>
<p>Johnston's project is to put this Lacanian register of desire,
understood as <em>the</em> contradiction in the multitude of drives a
subject suffers, in touch with the way that Marx talks about
<em>Trieb</em> in his theory and system of capital. He sees drive as a
commonality between these registers, in that in both "drives are
mediated productions instead of immediate givens"- and in that 'drive'
is the constitutive terms for the subject in society as such: "The
(drive-)object fabricates the subject (of drive)" <span class="citation"
data-cites="johnstonClosedNeedInfinite2017">(Johnston 2017,
280)</span>.</p>
<p>For subjects dominated by capital's abstract forms, the range of
possible materializations of desire's covering over are reduced to two
specific kinds of drive: <strong>capitalist drive</strong> (
<code>M-C-M'</code> ) and <strong>consumerist drive</strong> (
<code>C-M-C'</code> ). The capitalist is one who feeds money (
<code>M</code> ) into the economy with the hope and intention of
generating a greater quantity of money ( <code>M'</code> ). The
consumerist, on the other hand, is one who continues to take their
commodities to market ( <code>C</code> ) in order to procure more and
more different kinds of commodity ( <code>C'</code> ) in a fashion that
is 'plastically' related to their direct, reproductive need for
them.</p>
<p>Johnston is careful to distinguish between these two subject
positions Marx's theory of capital's contortion of desire, and he is
also careful the specific structure of the relationship that he sees as
giving rise to a compatibility between metapsychology and historical
materialism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>plastic drive structure, as theorized within a metapsychological
<em>qua</em> philosophical/psychoanalytic anthropology, is a necessary
condition for capitalism's peculiar libidinal economics as per
historical materialism. It becomes a sufficient condition [for one to
call it 'capitalism'] when capitalist production, spurred by the pursuit
of surplus value, begins exploiting this plasticity for its gains. <span
class="citation" data-cites="johnstonClosedNeedInfinite2017">(Johnston
2017, 283)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Psychoanalysis, in other words, theorizes a "plastic drive structure"
in the speaking being (human) <em>in general</em>, i.e. independent of
capitalism as a specific configuration of the condition of value's
production in society. Historical materialism, complementarily but with
a different scope, theorizes the contortion of desire - as reduced to
only two dialects of drive - by way of an historically specific mode of
production (movement of value) called capital. Johnston's analysis
exegetically focuses on the German word for drive that both Marx and
Freud use, <em>Trieb</em>, as Marx names the affect resulting from
capital's structure <em>eine besondre Form des Triebs</em> [a particular

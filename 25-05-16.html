<p>Chapter 22 of <em>Capital</em> Volume I– following the chapter
structure in the <a
href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691190075/capital">2024
English translation</a> - builds on <a href="./25-03-07.html">the
previous chapter on simple reproduction</a>, which had laid out the
impossible position of "economic bondage" <span class="citation"
data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx 2024, 532)</span> of
the wage laborer in relation to capital. Chapter 22 shifts from outling
the standpoint of the wage laborer to a closer look at the standpoint of
the capitalist, detailing how capital works through the reinvestment of
<strong>surplus value</strong>.</p>
<p>When the surplus value produced through the structure of the wage
relation is reinvested, it amounts to a process of
<strong>accumulation</strong>: "accumulation is the capitalist process
of reproduction on an ever-expanding scale" <span class="citation"
data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx 2024, 534)</span>.
Accumulation is a phenomenon that is produced under the aegis of a free
and fair exchange, but which in fact rests in the
<strong>exploitation</strong> of laborers. Though it is the laborer who
produces surplus value, it is the capitalist to whom it is owed. This is
why Marx calls the capitalist a false "legal representative" <span
class="citation" data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx
2024, 535)</span> of workers, as it is through an apparently legitimate
process (we might think here of 'democracy') that a figure who
represents interests antithetical to the workers' own comes to reside in
a seat of power. Unpaid labor, conjured through the reduction of labor
to labor-time in the form of a wage ("the invisible magic of the
production process" <span class="citation"
data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx 2024, 535)</span>),
is the common coin of this phony demagoguery.</p>
<p>Accumulation is the name for the reproduction of capital for its own
sake. The capitalist is not, according to Marx, a machiavellian villain
who selfishly <em>expropriates</em> value from the laborers he employs.
(This is one of the core distinctions between <em>expropriation</em> and
<em>exploitation</em> for Marx: the latter does not imply strictly overt
or conscious violence on the part of the dominating party.) The
capitalist is rather a role that is subject to the abstract domination
of capital's value forms, just like the wage laborer, though that
subjection has a different orientation. The wage laborer, as we saw in
chapter 21, is compelled to want more commodities, even at the expense
of her own reproduction, an orientation that can be denoted <span
class="math inline">$C-M-C\'$</span>. The capitalist, on the other hand,
is compelled to want more money, even at the expense of his own
reproduction, an orientation that amously can be denoted <span
class="math inline">$M-C-M\'$</span>. It is these two roles working in
tandem that produces accumulation, the movement of value specific to
capital, an infinite cycle of <span
class="math inline">$M-C-M\'-C\'-M\'$</span>. (The formal genesis of
this cycle, i.e. whether it is <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> that kicks accumulation off, is
the subject of the final chapter in Volume I, <em>The So-Called Original
Accumulation</em>.)</p>
<p>The search for surplus (<span class="math inline">$\'$</span>) for
its own sake is the driving motor of capital's process, the
characterizing feature of its implant in human subjectivity, whether its
installation produces a capitalist or consumerist 'affect':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether the new capital takes the form of money or the things that
make up the means of production and subsistence, its
<strong>substance</strong> is the product of a process that extracts
someone else's unpaid labor. Capital has produced capital. <span
class="citation" data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx
2024, 536)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marx's use of the word 'substance' here and elsewhere can be
understood to mean something similar to what I propose as a
'characterizing feature' above. It does not refer to a concrete and
material thing that can be touched, smelled, or felt that underlies
those airy, ideological phenomena that are palpably more conceptual. To
render 'substance' in this way is to read Marx against his own method,
to assert that there is a 'base' that can be consciously unearthed as a
'thing' that determines the 'superstructure'. Substance rather refers to
neither thing nor thought, but the dialectical space where they meet–
what Heidegger will later call <em>das Ding</em>. The substance of value
in capital, then, needs to be explained by way of the process of its
(conceptual <em>and</em> material) movement, from commodity to money to
surplus, such that we can see how (a certain conception of) labor is the
'ground' of the abstract domination at work in capital.</p>
<p>The network of notions of commodity, labor, value, and so on is what
reveals the notion of <strong>bourgeois ownership</strong> as one that
is turned inside-out. It parades as a transparent principle of 'each to
his own', but in fact (in 'substance') rests on the underhanded
dispossession of workers of their labor. The law of ownership is, in
other words, a law that harbors a contradiction within itself. Though an
"exchange of equivalents" is "the original operation", the outcome is
constitutively unequal <span class="citation"
data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx 2024,
537)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Owning yesterday's unpaid labor now appears as the sole precondition
for appropriating today's unpaid living labor on an ever-larger scale.
<span class="citation"
data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx 2024,
536)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A key point in the first section of this chapter is that the
capitalist is not, by definition, a miser. Accumulation can only take
place if "yesterday's unpaid labor" is put back into circulation, rather
than hoarded by miserly factory owners. This is not to say that those
playing the part of the capitalist in accumulation's equation do not
spend some of the surplus on themselves, buying commodities that they do
not need in pursuit of an ever-elusive total satisfaction. But this
drive is not what characterizes him as a capitalist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>insofar as the capitalist is personified capital, his driving
motivation is to have more and more exchange-value, not to acquire
use-value and experience pleasure. A fanatic when it comes to the
valorization of value, he ruthlessly forces human beings to produce for
production's sake…. Thus, insofar as the capitalist's behavior is merely
a function of the <em>capital that has taken on consciousness and a will
in him</em>, he sees his own private consumption as an act of theft
committed against the accumulation of his capital. <span
class="citation" data-cites="marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024">(Marx
2024, 542)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The affect driving the capitalist is a renunciation of private
consumption, an obscure and alien selflessness in service of
<em>capital's</em> reproduction, not his own.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
(One cannot help but think here of the numerous reports of investment
bankers commiting suicide upon hearing about the financial crash in
2008. Agents of capital to the end, life is no longer worth living where
accumulation has stalled.) Thus is capital a parasite on modern
subjectivity, which since at least the Enlightenment has prided itself
on the ability to reason first and foremost <em>for</em> oneself. In
capital, this vision of clear-headed reason is compromised. Reason
itself is unsound, for conscious abstraction in its own right seems to
suffer domination at the hands of the movement of value.</p>

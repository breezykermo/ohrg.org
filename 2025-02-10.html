</header>
<p>Last week I read the first two chapters of a book recommended to me
quite some time ago by a friend: <a
href="https://www.aup.nl/en/book/9789089647702/sacred-channels">Sacred
Channels: The Archaic Illusion of Communication</a> by Erich Hörl. The
book was published in English in 2018, but was defended as a
dissertation in 2003, and published in German in 2005. Friedrich Kittler
was the dissertation's second reader, and we learn from the introduction
that the manuscript was also read by Bernhard Siegert and André Gorz,
among others. Some pretty heavy philosophical and media-theoretical
hitters in the German-speaking context, in other words.</p>
<p>I am opening this book at last to begin working my way through the
history and philosophy of mathematics that is relevant to my
dissertation. The lineaments of this relevance are, broadly speaking,
those that trace the emergence of set theory around the turn of the 20th
century, and its culmination in the crisis of foundations orchestrated
by the young Kurt Gödel when he published <em>Über formal
unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter
Systeme</em> - 'On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia
Mathematica and Related Systems'. This curious and relatively obscure
turn of events in the history of mathematics has been heralded by some,
the author under consideration in this b/log– Erich Hörl– included, as
the climactic moments in an epistemological transition in philosophy and
thought at large which might be called the coming of modernity.</p>
<h1 id="thinking-and-so-being">Thinking and so being</h1>
<p>What does set theory and formalist mathematics have to do with
philosophical modernity? Hörl's claim is that, from as early as the
1830s, a "purely symbolic thinking clearly began to take shape in the
sciences" <span class="citation"
data-cites="horlSacredChannelsArchaic2018">(Hörl 2018, 33)</span>
Symbolic thinking is marked in distinction to its precursor, intuitive
thinking, which is construed as the reigning and preceding paradigm in
mathematical thought writ large.</p>
<p>For Hörl, the "great transformation from the intuitive to the
symbolic" <span class="citation"
data-cites="horlSacredChannelsArchaic2018">(Hörl 2018, 47)</span> is a
shift in the relationship between Thinking and Being. I capitalise these
two terms here to indicate that they designate presumed universal
notions, rather than simply historically contingent activities of
thinking and being.</p>
<p>Thinking (with a capital T) is the realm of appearances, the full
breadth of what is sensible to the subject. The subject, here, is a
<em>human</em> one in the sense that human is the word given to all
those entities capable of social life by dint of their capability for
language. Language, here, too, is not 'English' or 'Spanish'
exclusively, but a more holistic category that gets at the curious
phenomenon we often now call communication. Language is not language in
the strict linguistic sense of having a grammar, nouns, and verbs, but
is rather something more curious and not so easily locatable as a set of
articulate rules. Language is the name for the many syntaxes of
sociality, the protocol(s) through which subjects cooperate, live
together, and are insufficient to be themselves alone. Thinking is the
domain of what is cognisable and apparent in and as language, the full
sensibility of the world as it can be Thought.</p>
<p>Being, on the other hand, is what the world actually is, what
actually exists. It is the tree that falls in the forest without anyone
around to hear or think it. It is more durable and persistent than what
can be Thought, to some minds, as what <em>exists</em> in the world is
not necessarily coincident with what <em>appears</em> to those of us
subjects that are thinking within it.</p>
<p>If the distinction between Thinking and Being seems finicky, you are
not alone in this complaint. Whether or how Thinking and Being overlap
is a core question in philosophy. <strong>Ontology</strong> is the
investigations of what exists, to delimiting the domain of Being.
<strong>Epistemology</strong> is the complementary investigation of what
can appear transparently to subjects in the world, of the borders of the
domain of Thinking. The articulation of the latter usually (always?)
imples the former. Epistemology can really only be defined by nominating
whether or not there is anything that exceeds it. The exceptions in
Thinking, things which exist but which cannot be Thought, are the stuff
of ontology.</p>
<h1 id="intuition-is-the-key-to-everything">Intuition is the key to
everything</h1>
<p>For Hörl, the ascendance of symbolic reasoning in mathematics in the
early 19th century is a feature of a shift in the tectonics of Thinking
and Being. Hörl is a media theorist and not an historian, and he does
not clearly delimit the spatial parameters of what he sees as the age of
symbolic reason. (Is it only or primarily in Europe? Is it as intense in
France as it is in Germany? Does it suffuse the intellectual scene in
Kenya or Kyoto in any way?) But the general idea is that before this
age, the cutting edge of ontological proposition was secured through an
appeal to <u>intuition</u>.</p>
<p>Intuition is a term laden with Kantian suggestion, as it <a
href="https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/41579/what-is-intuition-for-kant">played
a complicated role</a> in Kant's philosophical system. The sum of it as
relevant to Hörl's argument is as follows. Kant was adamant that there
were some aspects of Thinking that we could take to be universal, that
is, that we could take to exist not just in particular instantiations,
but as general truths for all subjects. The echelon of Thinking that
Kant reckons universal is specifically that of Reason, and it is the
task of philosophy to shore up the boundaries of Reason so that its
factions do not contradict themselves; "to expose the illusions of a
reason that forgets its limits, and by sufficiently clarifying our
concepts to recall it from its presumptuous speculative pursuits to
<em>modest but thorough self-knowledge</em>" <span class="citation"
data-cites="ewaldKantHilbertVolume1999">(Ewald and Ewald 1999,
1:147)</span>. Whatever the specific cartography of this universal
Reason's shores, Kant was sure that Thinking could eventually map them.
There are some kinds of Thinking, in other words, of which we can be
sure. The surety of Reason's forms appear to us through
<em>intuition</em>, a capability (of sorts) that allows subjects to make
out the shape of structures that undergird the many specific
sensualities that appear in the world. Intuition, in other words, is
what ensures that the hypothetical play of structures and patterns in
logic (Thinking) have something to do with what is actually out there in
the world (Being). For Kant there is a necessary overlap between
Thinking and Being, albeit probably a 'modest' one, about which
'thorough' thinking is fundamentally able to reason.</p>
<p>As Hörl is working in a media-theoretical paradigm that follows
Kittler, he periodises and defines this (Kantian) era in the
relationship between Thinking and Being as an "optical-medial paradigm
of consciousness" <span class="citation"
data-cites="horlSacredChannelsArchaic2018">(Hörl 2018, 51)</span>.
Structures and associations appear in the mind of subject as apparitions
of sensual particularities in the world <em>through the lens of
intuition</em>, much like the shadows playing on the wall of Plato's
cave. Intuition is what secures that there is <em>some</em> reality that
can be disambiguated from fantasy in the observance of such shadows.
Good, philosophical thinking in Kant's cave is the diligent picking-out
of objective patterns, forming a structure in the mind that extracts
only what is objectively there in the world, and as such will not be
contradicting by any particular play of shadows.</p>
<h1 id="leibniz-leading-the-blind">Leibniz leading the blind</h1>
<p>The first chapter of Hörl's book wrestles with how one should think
about the crisis of intuition and its giving way to a notion of
<strong>the symbolic</strong> that was not secured by the same kind of
intuition, or at least not in the same way. He evocatively refers to
this new paradigm as <strong>blind thinking</strong>. The
media-theoretical avoidance of any requirement that time be stratified
as linear, and thus a period given a specific date to inaugurate it, is
clear from the chapter's title; 'Blind thinking <em>around</em> 1900'
(my emphasis). Symbolic thinking is blind because Leibniz labeled it as
such (<em>cogitatio caece</em>) in his aspiration to designate
structures of association that exist in the world without any
contingency in Thought:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leibniz had been working on an autonomous symbolic freed from the
fetters of the representation of objects and had philosophically
conceptualized the formal use of symbols in algorithmic mathematics in
terms of a purely symbolic knowledge…. As the "pioneer of the
<em>idea</em> of calculus"– that is of a purely formal manipulation of
signs free of all interpretation– he kept to the
<strong>blindness</strong> of using symbols despite all the evidence of
immediate, instantaneous viewing…. Because it proceeded nonintuitively
and was not founded on the evidence of an insight, Leibniz called
symbolic knowledge "blind" (<em>caeca</em>). <span class="citation"
data-cites="horlSacredChannelsArchaic2018">(Hörl 2018, 58–60)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leibniz's project of calculus is nominated as a decisive break from
Kant's '20/20' vision of philosophical reason. In the symbolic paradigm
of Thinking and Being, there was no essential security that structures
of Thought had any bearing on entities in the world. One can search for
consistency in symbols in thought and in theory (this enterprise has
come to be known as pure mathematics), but there was no guarantee that
such Thinking had anything to do with Being. Thinking after Leibniz,
Hörl contends, is fundamentally detached from Being, as there is no
longer much Kantian faith in an intuition that binds them together.</p>
<p>It is interesting to me that Leibniz's calculus becomes an
"autonomous symbolic", as I have written elsewhere about the status of
capital as an autonomous subject in Marx. How is it that the symbolic is
'autonomous'? The domain of the symbolic is no longer bound to the
particularities and peculiarities of subjectivity; it is no longer a
domain that exists only 'interiorly' as shadows in the mind. The
symbolic now exists for itself, autonomously. We as subjects are simply
capable of observing it. No longer shackled as shadows in the cavernous
minds of stuck subjects, the symbolic now shares the status of real
objects out there in the world. It has been freed, made autonomous, just
as Socrates had always hoped might be possible for subjects were we all
to become philosophers (such that we might no longer stare only at
shadows on the wall).</p>
<h1 id="kittler-in-the-kitchen">Kittler in the kitchen</h1>
<p>In reading these first few chapters, it seems that Hörl is making use
of the Lacanian terms symbolic, imaginary, and the real in a Kittlerian
manner. What does it mean to use these terms in a Kittlerian manner,
exactly? I admit that I need to return to Kittler's work in order to
properly reason through this question, in particular his 1986 book <a
href="https://www.sup.org/books/media-studies/gramophone-film-typewriter">Gramophone,
Film, Typewriter</a> (translated to English in 1999), as I last looked
at his work as an undergraduate (with very different scholarly eyes).
This book is a definitional text in German-American media theory, as it
makes out three epistemological paradigms in the 20th century– that of
the gramophone, of film, and of the typewriter– arguing that each medium
represents the conditions of Thinking in its respective historical
specificity. Kittler does this using the Lacanian triumvirate, as is
summarized by this excerpt from <a
href="https://labyrinthine-works.fandom.com/wiki/Gramophone,_Film,_Typewriter">this
(curious) wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gramophone appeals to the real, functions as an analog
representation of the voice, and maintains the voice of the dead (the
scream of the dying over radio). Film functions as the imaginary,
capturing not light waves but the effect of light waves, and reproducing
our illusory doppleganger before our eyes at a speed too fast to capture
difference. The typewriter corresponds to the symbolic, a symbolic order
now stripped of its inherent relationship to male thought as thousands
of women enter into the typing fields.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Gramophone</td>
<td>the Real</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Film</td>
<td>the Imaginary</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Typewriter</td>
<td>the Symbolic</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I don't know of work that directly criticizes Kittler for this
schematic, though I imagine that there must be some, as (by my very
nascent understanding) it seems strange to figure each of Lacan's terms
as more active in a particular historical period, at the very least.
There is something suspiciously Foucauldian about the attempt, which is
not surprising, given that I believe that Kittler explicitly invokes
Foucault (and Derrida) in <em>Gramophone</em> as intellectual
inspiration. It figures the terms as a set of equivalent intensities in
relation to each other, rather than as aspects of the same topological
structure. To be sure, I am no expert in either Lacan or Foucault, and
so perhaps there is a way hold both conceptions effectively in mind at
the same time. This problem inspires me to read Kittler's
<em>Gramophone</em> in the coming days, a trial that I may report on
here in one form or another.</p>
<p>The reason I will return to Kittler is that I find Hörl's
mobilisation of the Lacanian triumvirate compelling; but I am as yet
uncertain as to whether it is helpful to frame the history of Thought in
such belletristic terms. For Hörl, the Symbolic (Lacanian or otherwise)
is evidently associated with the formal-mathematical symbolic of Boole,
of imaginary numbers (both discussed in chapter 2), and of the symbolic
'turn' in the history of mathematics. The Imaginary, in contrast, is
affiliated with the intuitionist mapping of mathematical structure to
the 'real world', as Hörl argues was the case with geometry before its
non-Euclidean awakenings (the invasion of the sanctity of Kantian
intuition as mathematics' epistemological foundation by the formal
modernity of Leibnizian and Boolean symbolic operationalism). The
Symbolic, on this view, is constituted by the paradigm of
<em>non-contradiction</em>, whereas the Imaginary is is an apparent
fortress of philosophical reality constructed on the sense that there is
some fundamental channel between what one thinks (or can imagine) and
what is actually out there in the world, a channel called intuition.</p>
<p>The ascendancy of the symbolic from 1830 through 1850, and whose
monarchy of names such as Russell and Hilbert was overthrown by the
popular demagogue of reason that goes by Gödel, seems to be Hörl's
Kittlerian periodizing of the slow takeover of modernity. Perhaps Hörl
is simply tracing the Kittlerian thesis in <em>Gramophone</em> by way of
different historical roots?</p>
